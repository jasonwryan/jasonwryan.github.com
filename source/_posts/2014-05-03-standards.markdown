Late last month there was a post on 
[Meta Stack Overflow](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/251758/why-is-stack-overflow-so-negative-of-late 'All the hate…') wondering why SO is “so negative of late.” Reading through the
extensive list of answers, and all the comments that quickly adhered to them
like barnacles on a becalmed schooner, it was hard not to extrapolate to the
experiences of online communities elsewhere, especially in the free and open
software world. Stack Overflow is going on six years old now and has grown to
be a truly formidable<sup>1</sup> resource for programmers, *dilettantes*—the
category to which I clearly belong—and, apparently, people wanting their
homework done for them. This isn't the first time this question has been raised
there, and I am sure it won't be the last.

I don't spend [much time on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/users/712613/jasonwryan 'My SO profile'),
mostly because I am not a programmer and so I don't have much to contribute there, but also because
I [am active on Unix & Linux](http://unix.stackexchange.com/users/6761/jasonwryan 'U&L profile')<sup>2</sup>, 
one of the clones that has emerged out of the metastasizing StackExchange
empire. I do, however, subscribe to quite a few of the <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> 
feeds for question tags on SO: things like #awk, #bash, and other topics that are of interest
to me. Given the amount of noise in these feeds; in the form of redundancy (ie., questions
that have been asked in one form or another *many* times before) or just a signal failure to read
*any* documentation, it is not surprising that the people responsible for this degradation
see the site as negative, or unfriendly, or elitist. This is perfectly natural: it is the
community attempting to defend itself from
[help vampires](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/03/17/vampires/ 'Post on the scourge').

What was also quite predictable, given StackExchange's response to this “problem” which was the
2012 [Summer of Love](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/07/kicking-off-the-summer-of-love/ 'SE Blog post')
campaign where they wanted to make SO a more friendly place, was that this would only 
exacerbate the issue. My experience of the site over that time is that the signal to noise has
not improved at all, quite the contrary. I think that setting an expectation that the site
would be more welcoming has two perverse consequences: first, it validates the perceptions
of the newcomers about purported hostility, and in doing so signals to the existing community
that built the value of the site that their culture needs remediation. Secondly, it signals 
more tolerance for behaviours that add no value to the community; so it is hardly surprising
to see those behaviours proliferate.

From time to time the Arch community faces exactly the same criticisms: we are unfriendly, 
or elitist. I neither agree with these types of comments, nor am I particularly perturbed by
them. Arch is a small community of volunteers, in order to create an environment where people
who are willing and able to actively contribute, I think is important to ensure that there
are clearly articulated standards<sup>3</sup> and that they are maintained by the
community at large. 

I don't see any scope for increasing the community's tolerance for vampirism or the sort
of self-entitlement that has a sad habit of appearing from time-to-time:

<blockquote> As for the Arch team and their lacking resources, let's take your point at face value.  Now, we've known what the problem is for almost four hours and no fix has been issued.</blockquote>

There is some sort of “problem” that “we” have known about for *four hours* and
yet, inconceivably<sup>4</sup>, *nothing* has been done about it?

There is no bug report on the [Arch tracker](https://bugs.archlinux.org/ 'Flyspray') so 
I am not sure why the collective pronoun is warranted here, that quibble aside; in what 
universe is this sort of petulance considered acceptable? The only reasonable response
to this sort of whining is to close the thread and ban the infractor and their progeny, who
will no doubt suffer from the same sort of genetic deficiencies, *in perpetuam*…

Clearly articulating, and enforcing, minimum standards of behaviour doesn't
make your community hostile or unfriendly; it establishes boundaries for people
that supports respectful collaboration and the effective ability of that
community to self-moderate.  People new to the community who take the time to
read the guidelines and observe how things work will have no problem
adapting<sup>5</sup>. It may not make you popular, but it will make a
significant contribution to the sustainability of the community and the levels
of engagement of those that do contribute and wish to continue doing so.
