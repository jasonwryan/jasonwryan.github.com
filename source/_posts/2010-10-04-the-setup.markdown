Inspired by [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/)<sup>1</sup>, I decided to document
the free (as in [freedom](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html))
and open source software tools I use daily.

I made the move to using open-source about four years ago. At the time
it was mostly a practical decision — the Pentium 4 laptop that I was
using with XP on it had slowed to a crawl and I wasn’t keen to replace
it, so I installed Ubuntu (Hardy Heron) on it and haven’t looked back.

That same machine, incidentally, is still happily churning away, but it
now runs a lightweight [Debian Stable](http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/).

### Desktop
My primary home machine is a one I had built from spec two to three
years ago. It was always intended to be a long-term investment, with
sufficient power and storage to last for the better part of a decade.

Centurion is an 
[Asus P5E-V motherboard](http://www.asus.com/Product.aspx?P_ID=cXoprTXLaShErTzI&content=specifications)
with an 
[Intel Core 2 Quad 6600 2.4GHz CPU](http://www.intel.com/products/processor/core2quad/index.htm) and
4GB of DDR2 RAM. The sound card is an 
[M-Audio Audiophile 2496](http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/Audiophile2496.html) and the
graphics card is a 
[1GB nVidia GeForce 9600GT](http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_9600gt_us.html)
driving an LG 22” flat panel 1680x1050 display.

#### Software
I dual boot this machine, switching between the current
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) (10.04) and [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org).

There are two 1TB Seagate drives in a [RAID1 array](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID),
and a 500GB Seagate which has Arch on it as well as a couple of virtual machines. 
I back up the RAID array frequently, using [rsync](http://www.samba.org/rsync/), as it
holds my <span class="file">/home</span> but don’t worry about the 500GB drive 
as I figure it is simple to reinstall Arch or a virtual machine…

I try to use the same software across all of my machines to simplify my
working habits, however I am experiencing some tension between Ubuntu
and Arch insofar as Arch is a rolling release and you very quickly get
used to the most recent builds…

Applications specific to the Ubuntu box include:

* [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.net/): I also have
[Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) installed on this machine, but
stick with the ‘fox for [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) and other
extensions

* [Thunderbird](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/): with
the [Enigmail](http://enigmail.mozdev.org/home/index.php.html)
extension. One of those areas of tension - it’s just a matter of time
before I move to `mutt` (see EeePC)

* [Squeezeserver](http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/SlimServer): I
have a Logitech Squeezebox to serve my music and it runs off this great
open source software

* [Virtualbox](http://www.virtualbox.org/) (OS): for running virtual
machines - currently [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/) and
[FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/).

### EeePC 901
Archer is a 901 I bought two years ago – the 
[Linux model with the 4/16GB SSD](http://eeepc.asus.com/au/product901-spec.html), and I
absolutely love it. I put a second GB of RAM into it and another 16GB SD
Card (for /music) and it does everything that I need. The 
[Atom 1.6GHz processor](http://www.intel.com/products/processor/atom/index.htm)
handles compiling relatively smartly and the screen and keyboard, while
small (9” at 1024x600) are not uncomfortable to use for protracted
sessions. It is also *deathly quiet*. The only other addition is a
second 6 cell battery so I can safely count on 8-10 hours out of it.

One of the reasons that it works so efficiently is that it is an
*extremely* minimal Arch Linux setup.

#### Software
Applications specific to this machine are:

-   [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org "dwm page on suckless"): *the*
    suckless window manager. With added functionality of some patches:
    init-pertag, cycle and push: see [the patchset for
    details](https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/tip/Build/dwm/5.8.2-2.diff)
-   [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/): application launcher,
    again from suckless.org
-   [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/): the best email client I have used -
    requires some setup, but –if you want your mail client to run
    exactly as you would like– then this one repays the investment in
    spades. Mutt is just a MUA, the rest of the email cycle is handled
    by:
    -   [offlineimap](http://github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/wiki): to
        fetch mail
    -   [msmtp](http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/): to send mail
    -   [GnuPG](http://www.gnupg.org/): for signing and encryption
    -   [abook](http://abook.sourceforge.net/): address book
    -   [urlview](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/urlview1.html) and
        [lynx](http://lynx.browser.org/): open urls from mutt

-   ~~[uzbl](http://www.uzbl.org/): a lightweight webkit browser that is
    infintely extensible and
    [configurable](https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/tip/.config/uzbl/config)~~^2^
-   [Vimprobable](http://www.vimprobable.org/) in
    [tabbed](http://tools.suckless.org/tabbed): another lightweight
    webkit browser that can be
    [customized](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonwryan/5063510130/ "Screenshot on Flickr")
    to your heart’s desire…
-   A host of small programs that make life easy:
    -   [feh](https://derf.homelinux.org/projects/feh/): image viewer
    -   [autocutsel](http://www.nongnu.org/autocutsel/): synchronize
        clipboards
    -   [dzen](http://sites.google.com/site/gotmor/dzen) and
        [conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/): to print system stats to
        dwm’s status bar
    -   [surfraw](http://surfraw.alioth.debian.org/): command line
        search client
    -   [unclutter](http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/X11/contrib/utilities/unclutter-8.README):
        hides the mouse cursor (don’t really need a mouse with this
        setup)
    -   [xmodmap](http://www.xfree86.org/4.2.0/xmodmap.1.html): map Caps
        Lock to Escape

#### Common tools

Applications and utilities that I use across all of my machines include:

- [Urxvt](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html): I would’nt
  dream of using another terminal… Run as a daemon, with these
  applications:

    -   [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/): for local and remote terminal
        sessions
    -   [Vim](http://www.vim.org/): with a [simple notes function](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/09/28/command-line-notes/) 
        in my .bashrc
    -   [Vifm](http://vifm.sourceforge.net/): Vi-like file manager – for
        when I am not using
        [coreutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)
    -   [TTYtter](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/): fantastic
        Twitter client: if it could integrate Identi.ca into a single feed,
        it would be perfect…
    -   [irssi](http://irssi.org/): for IRC
    -   [Mplayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html): for movies
    -   [MPD](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki) and
        [ncmpcpp](http://unkart.ovh.org/ncmpcpp/): music player daemon and
        ncurses player
    -   [mpdscribble](http://code.google.com/p/mpdscribble/): for scrobbling
        to Libre.fm and Last.fm
    -   [rtorrent](http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/): run inside tmux for
    remote sessions. Genius.

- [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/): the daemon is closed source, but
  this is the best tool I have found for synching across machines. If the
  Ubuntu One devs ever focus on other Linux distros, I’d move across.
- [Truecrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/): a TC volume in Dropbox and you
  are set
- [Skype](http://www.skype.com/intl/en/home).

#### Other Utilities
I use [mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) and
[bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/) to share my dotfiles
between Arch machines (one of my work boxes is also running Arch). I
have two [Linksys WRT54GL routers](http://www.linksysbycisco.com/EU/en/products/WRT54GL), both
running [Tomato](http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato), to handle my routing
and wireless networking (thanks to
[@jethrocarr](http://twitter.com/jethrocarr "Jethro on Twitter") for
solving that puzzle). For LAN file sharing I use
[NFS](http://nfs.sourceforge.net/) and I use
[OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/) to access my machines remotely. I
have a third generation [iPod](http://guides.macrumors.com/iPod_(3G))
and I run [Rockbox](http://www.rockbox.org/) on it.

You can see screenshot of these machines on
[flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonwryan).

##### Notes
1. …and the fact that, apart from RMS, it is pretty much MacBookPros
all the way down.
