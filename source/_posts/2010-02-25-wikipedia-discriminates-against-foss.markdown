There is currently an interesting debate on Wikipedia about [deleting the article on dwm.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dwm "Wikipedia page")

According to the Wikipedia [notability guidelines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability "Wikipedia page"),
only

> significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the
> subject

constitutes notability.

So 300 words by the likes of [Randall Kennedy](http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=31024 "ZDNet article exposing corrupt practice in Tech reporting")
counts for more in terms of “notability” than the hundreds of thousands
of lines of code contributed to
[dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/ "dwm wiki") and its forks
([awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/ "awesome home page") and
[echinus](http://www.rootshell.be/~polachok/code/ "echinus page")) and
clones ([xmonad](http://www.xmonad.org/ "xmonad homepage"),
[musca](http://aerosuidae.net/musca.html "musca homepage"),
[scrotwm](http://www.peereboom.us/scrotwm/html/scrotwm.html) *et al*)?

The notion that, in the free/libre and open source software world, a
project’s notability is measured in terms of the *prose* that appears in
journals, books etc is myopic and—in terms of Wikipedia’s status as a
FOSS project—quite disappointing. The real measure of notability of
projects like this is the **code they generate**.

Wikipedia’s criteria actively discriminates against free and open source
projects where the measure of notability is not the column inches in
trade magazines sponsored by advertising and advertorial, but by the
passion and commitment of large communities of contributors who believe
in the project enough to devote their code, time and money.

Wikipedians need to review their criteria to reflect this reality;
otherwise the “free encyclopedia” will continue to exclude exactly those
free/libre projects…
