Over the last couple of months there have been a number of discussions on the Arch boards
about the 
[forum policy](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Forum_Etiquette#Arch_Linux_Distribution_Support_ONLY 'Forum Etiquette')
of only providing support for Arch Linux, culminating in this
[long thread about Archbang users](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=157361 'Arch Forum thread')
(login required) being denied support and having their threads summarily
closed. As it emerged in the discussion, there seem to be two separate issues
at play here; the question of Arch-derivatives using the Arch brand (logo,
colours and even the forum style sheets), and how the wider community of
GNU/Linux distributions are treated on our boards.

The first issue is relatively simple to address. Allowing derivative
distributions to use the Arch brand is, in my view, a mistake. It dilutes the
value of the Arch “brand” and—as can be seen when people show up having
installed a derivative and thinking they are running Arch—just confuses people.

For some of these derivatives, like Archbang, there is an argument to be made
that once they have completed the installation process, they are in fact
running Arch, albeit an off-the-shelf version. I find this argument to be
specious. All of the derivatives that I have come across, in addition to
“simplifying”<sup>1</sup> the installation process and including `X` and some
sort of desktop or window manager by default, also make a number of other
system changes that invalidate their claim to being Arch by another name.

See this [scathing review of Manjaro](http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/yj2v5/a_new_guibased_version_of_arch_has_gone_live/c5wc6yo 'Reddit thread on Manjaro Linux')
or Allan's [roundup of the Arch Spin-Offs](http://allanmcrae.com/2012/12/battle-of-the-arch-spin-offs/ 'Allan McRae's blog')
for the details on the decisions these developers make that mean it is not
practicable to support them on the Arch boards, nor desirable to do so in
future. As a distro, Arch is essentially vanilla packages, pacman and rolling
release, and a base on which 
[you build your preferred system](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way#User-centric 'The Arch Way'). 
Changing two of those three means that you are not running Arch…

That leads in to the second point, which is I'll paraphrase as “well, we are
all Linux users, so everyone should be welcome to ask for support from Arch
users.” It is a fine sentiment, but one that is neither 
[historically accurate](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#forum 'ESR's seminal document'), 
nor in the long term interests of Arch. I have harped on in the past about 
[help vampires](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/03/17/vampires/ 'My post on the taxonomy of suckers…')
and last year I came across the perfect illustration of the unchecked effects
of this phenomena:

{% blockquote Alison Randall, Ubuntu Technical Architect. Linux Format July 2012 %}
Right now I'd say the bug queues are flooded with bugs that you can't really act on… It's a strain on the project that there are so many users that don't really get it.
{% endblockquote %}

Your bugtracker becomes essentially unusable. Your forums end up the same way.
No-one ends up getting much in the way of assistance at all, let alone anything
approaching informed help. That may be an inevitable consequence of the
collision between considerable but still finite resources and a philosophy of being
the <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> of the masses; Arch has
nothing like that in terms of resources, and a very different 
[philosophy](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way 'The Arch Way, again…').

That philosophy doesn't include anything about shortcuts or commoditized images
for a mass user base. It doesn't mention making the installation and
maintenance of your system completely idiot-proof so as to facilitate a
relentless march to the very top of whatever spurious distro popularity ranking
system you subscribe to. And it certainly doesn't say anything about your
entitlement to immediate and courteous support from the Arch community in the
face of your own inability to reach a minimum level of understanding of what it
is that you have installed on your hard drive.

If you think that you can just skip the whole tiresome 
[RTFM thing](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/02/08/documentation/ 'Post on documentation')
by downloading a derivative and installing that, how exactly do you expect to be able 
to run a rolling release distro that has, on average, a couple of 
[significant changes](https://www.archlinux.org/news/ 'Arch news') every year? 

Sooner or later you are going to have to come to terms with *the responsibility* 
that is an integral part of this type of rolling release and, if you have
installed it yourself, you will be much better placed to be able to build on
that understanding and broaden and deepen your knowledge of your system. 

That is ultimately far more satisfying for you, and much more beneficial for
the rest of the community as it means that you will be more able and likely to
contribute back in whatever way that you can; reporting bugs to a functioning
bug tracker, editing the [fine Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org 'The finest, actually'), 
maintaining packages in [the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org 'Arch User Repository'), 
submitting patches, etc.  Doing all the things that will
sustain Arch and continue to make it an attractive distribution for competent
GNU/Linux users and those that are willing to invest the time to become so.

#### Notes
1. If you have used the Arch install scripts, you would appreciate that it is
   not really possible to provide a simpler installation process.
