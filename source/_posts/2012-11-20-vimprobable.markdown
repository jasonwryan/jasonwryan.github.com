I have written about [Vimprobable](http://vimprobable.org 'Vimprobable homepage') 
a couple of times over the last two years<sup>1</sup>,
it is one of those projects that, for a variety of reasons, I have picked up
and stuck with.  Like [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org 'dwm homepage'),
[Vim](http://vim.org 'Vim homepage') and 
[tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/ 'tmux homepage'),
it is an essential part of my working environment and is installed on all of my
machines, where it is my default browser. It's simplicity, power and
configurability are why, despite looking at a few other similar projects, I
have stuck with Vimprobable since first installing it.

After my last post, a [dwm screencast](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/09/28/screencast/ 'An intro to dwm'), 
I wanted to have another crack at making a decent screencast. Sadly,
this is not it.  I can say that making a *good* screencast is not a simple
accomplishment; there are so many elements that require significant attention. I
spent a good many hours this time around playing with custom Xorg modelines,
`ffmpeg`'s arcane encoding options and, to be frank, the final product is just not worth
all that effort.

I'm going to stick with plain text from now on. It requires little more from me
than a passing acquaintance with the subject matter, some loosely held and
[firmly expressed opinions](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/08/18/trolls/ 'Trolling Arch Linux') 
and my unbridled confidence in the fact that anyone who
has read this far down the page is so bereft of other, more pressing things to
think about that they may inadvertently find a scintilla of amusement in hereâ€¦

With that explanation out of the way, I give you my final screencast:
