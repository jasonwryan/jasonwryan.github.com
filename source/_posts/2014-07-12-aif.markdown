It is now almost exactly two years since the <acronym title="Arch Installer Framework">AIF</acronym>
was [put out to pasture](https://www.archlinux.org/news/install-media-20120715-released/ 'Arch News item').
At the time, it caused a degree of consternation, inexplicably causing some to
believe that it presaged the demise of—if not Arch itself, then certainly the
community around it. And I think it would be fair to say that it was the signal
event that launched a number of spin-offs, the first of which from memory was
Archbang; soon followed by a number of others that promised “Arch Linux with an
easy installation,” or something to that effect…

Of course, if you look back at the Installation Guide immediately before the
move to the new scripts, for example the version that shipped with the last AIF
in
[October, 2011](https://projects.archlinux.org/aif.git/tree/doc/official_installation_guide_en?id=4b075d9cd09b5a0912528bd94ae2a0d4eeb2d7f9 'In the Git repository'), it is pretty evident that
the [current approach](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide 'Installation Guide')
is *a lot* simpler. Sure, there is no curses <acronym title="Graphic User
Interface">GUI</acronym> to step you through each part of the install but the
introduction of `pacstrap` and `arch-chroot` meant that you no longer need those
prompts.

There is also the added advantage that these scripts are useful outside the
installation process itself; they can be used for system maintenance and, in
the rare event that your recent bout of experimentation at 2am after a few
drinks doesn't pan out the way you anticipated, repair.

One of the other responses to the new approach, however, has been the steady
proliferation of “helpful” install scripts. These are essentially bash scripts
that emulate the behaviour of the AIF and walk people through an automated
install of their system. Well, not really their system, more accurately *a*
system. So you run one of these scripts, answer a few prompts and then, when
you reboot, you have a brand spanking new Arch Linux install running KDE with
the full panoply of software and, in a few special cases, some customized dot
files to “enhance” your experience.

From a certain perspective, I can see how these things appeal. “I wonder if I
could script an entire install, from the partitioning right through to the
desktop environment?” That sounds like a fun project, right? Where it all comes
unstuck, unfortunately, is when the corollary thought appears that suggests
sharing it with the wider community would be a good idea. It is at this point
that a rigorous bout of self-examination about the outcomes that you are
seeking and your base motivations for this act of selflessness are called for.

Whatever those motivations are, whether driven by altruism or the naked desire
for fame and fortune that have—from time to time—alighted on these projects
when they appear on /r/archlinux and the adoring throngs bestow their favours
in equal measures of upvotes and bitcoin, they are grotesquely misplaced. No
good comes from these things, I tell you; none.

Why not? Because, in the guise of being helpful, you are effectively depriving
people of the single most important part of using Arch: building it themselves.
It's like inviting someone to a restaurant for an amazing *haute cuisine* meal,
sitting them down across the table from you and then them watching as the 
staff bring out a mouth-watering array of dishes, each of which you 
ostentatiously savour before vomiting it all back into their mouth.

Now, I am sure there is a small minority (well, at least from my own
sheltered experience I imagine it is small) who would
[relish this scenario](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetophilia 'Wikipedia: SFW'),
but for most it would qualify as a pretty disappointing date.

Then, after the technicolour *table d'hôte*, there is the matter of the
clean up. Recently, we had someone show up on the 
[Arch boards](http://bbs.archlinux.org 'Community forums') who had
“installed Arch” but who did not understand how to edit a text file;
literally had no clue how to open a file like <span class="file">/etc/fstab</span>
make some changes and then save it. This is beyond stupid; it is a drain
on the goodwill of the community that has to deal with this ineptitude, it
is unfair on people to put them in a position where they feel they are
at the mercy of their technology, rather than in control of it, and it
does nothing to advance the interests of Arch.

If you want to write something like this to improve your scripting skills,
by all means proceed. If you want to contribute to Arch, then pick a
project to contribute to, some bugs to squash, wiki edits, whatever; just
don't publish another one of these idiotic scripts, because you aren't
doing anyone any favours, quite the contrary.
