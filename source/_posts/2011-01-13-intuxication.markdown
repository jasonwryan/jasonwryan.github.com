I have previously posted about using 
[Mercurial to share dotfiles](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010-02-10-using-mercurial-to-share-dotfiles "Mu post on using mercurial"),
and how I have been using
[bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/ "bitbucket homepage") as a free host
for that service.

Recently, I came across
[Intuxication](http://beta.intuxication.org/ "Free mercurial hosting"),
who describe themselves thus:

> Intuxication provides a free, fast and lightweight platform to host
> your Mercurial repositories.

You will see from their URL that they are only in beta, but the service—while 
undeniably rough around the edges—looks quite promising.

For small projects, the limit is 1GB disk space, Intuxication provides
all of the basic features you need to maintain a mercurial repository.

One of the advantages it has over bitbucket is that the default
stylesheet makes it much easier to read the files that you host. And
while there are obviously plans to introduce more styles (from the
Configure menu you can select a dropdown of five different styles),
currently only one works.

If I had any criticism at all, it would be that the unfinished nature of
the website (like the broken styles and the fact that quite a few of the
other features like that don’t work) means that it feels a lot more like
an alpha than a beta.

However, I’m sure that with time and some support (there is a donate
button on every page), Intuxication will continue to develop. I think it
is a site with potential, and I’m currently pushing my 
[EeePC dotfiles](http://beta.intuxication.org/jasonwryan/archer/browse/tip/ "EeePC tip")
there.
