Breakage is one of the memes of the Arch Linux community; it is referenced frequently on the
[Arch boards](https://bbs.archlinux.org/ 'Arch Linux BBS') and in the various
[IRC channels](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IRC_Channels 'Wiki page listing channels').
It doesn't take newcomers long to realize that, whether something is actually broken or not,
there is always 
[someone they can blame](http://allanmcrae.com/category/arch-linux/ 'Allan's Blog').<sup>1</sup>

My experience of Arch, over the last three and a bit years, is quite the opposite. I have yet to
experience anything that would qualify as breakage. Sure, there have been bugs, mostly upstream,
and the more frequent moments where I haven't been as diligent as I should, but not once have I
had a machine that was unbootable or otherwise unusable. Arch has, on both my home and work
machines, been incredibly stable and reliable.

For a number of Arch Linux users, however, that was not their experience over the last week when
[/lib was moved to /usr/lib](http://www.archlinux.org/news/the-lib-directory-becomes-a-symlink/ 'News item on the move').
The volume of people on the boards and on IRC reporting unbootable or unusable systems was 
remarkable. Remarkable because, despite the fact that the 
[news item](http://www.archlinux.org/news/the-lib-directory-becomes-a-symlink/ 'Once more, just in case…'), the 
[wiki page](http://www.archlinux.org/news/the-lib-directory-becomes-a-symlink/ 'Arch wiki page on the change'),
and the [email to arch-announce](http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-announce/2012-July/000317.html 'Mail archive')
all *explicitly* warned people not to use the `--force` option,<sup>2</sup> so many did.

Sadly, these red-boxed warnings were apparently not enough. 
{" 90% of the breakage was because people either didn't see, or disregarded, that advice. "} 
The remaining 10% were either in a hurry and didn't pay close attention to how
to deal with any leftover files in <span class="file">/lib</span> or `rm -rf`'ed
in the wrong directory. 
[Accidents happen](http://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/shit-happens.html 'GNU Humour…').

What I am interested in is the people who fell into the much larger category,
and principally those that didn't see any of the communications about this
change in advance of updating and reasoned, based on a recent change that did
[require the use of --force](http://www.archlinux.org/news/filesystem-upgrade-manual-intervention-required-1/ 'News item on filesystem upgrade'),
that this was the most expedient way to resolve `pacman` reporting conflicting
files.

Some context. The `glibc` update was released to the 
[\[testing\] repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Testing#.5Btesting.5D 'Wiki entry on Testing')
in the first week of July: and there were a couple of long threads<sup>3</sup>
about issues and fixes before it was pushed to \[core\]. By the time the
package was released for general consumption, it had been tested and the
developers had obviously planned how to make what is a fundamental system
change with a minimal amount of user intervention.  I think that, given the
magnitude of the challenge, they did a superb job.

How then did it go so wrong for so many?<sup>4</sup> To answer that, you have
to consider the nature of Arch. It's *not* the sort of distribution where you
install it and then just go on your merry way, installing 
[the least obsolete packages](http://oswatershed.org/ 'It's SCIENCE, Jim'),
revelling in the speed of the package manager and generally being
a 1337 h@x0r…

Successfully running a rolling release like Arch, irrespective of your level of
competence, means staying in touch with what is happening—in 
[some form or other](http://kmkeen.com/pacmatic/ 'Pacman wrapper that pulls news updates'). 
Subscribing to the arch-general <acronym title="Mailing list">ML</acronym>, 
visiting the forums, idling in IRC; somehow remaining connected to what is
going on in the community so that you don't blindly update one day and wonder
why your system is broken.

This strikes me as a real strength; by design Arch encourages its users to
participate in the community. Even if you are only lurking, over time you will
inevitably find yourself posting in a thread, responding to an email, editing
the wiki,
[adopting an orphaned package](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/03/09/aurphan/ 'Post on aurphan')—increasingly 
getting involved and contributing.

This level of involvement is not for everyone. Some may find it onerous or
a waste of their time. That's fine. There are any number of other distros
that do not ask for this level of commitment. The *quid pro quo* for
running Arch, though, is that you are prepared, in whatever shape or form
best works for you, to give something back; at the very least, that is your
attention.

#### Notes
1. This is, of course, a reference to said Arch meme: Allan is one
of the developers who has contributed an enormous amount to Arch and the fact
that his IRC nick is `allanbrokeit` is purely coincidental.

2. At the end of 2011, the short option `-f` 
[was removed](http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/pacman-dev/2011-October/014589.html 'Post to ML anouncing change') 
from `pacman` so “it at least makes people read the word 'force' and maybe they
will have some sense to step back and think about what they are doing first.”

[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=144616](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=144616)

4. Relatively speaking. In situations like this, the overwhelming amount of traffic
is about what went wrong, not people posting to say they had no difficulties whatsoever…
