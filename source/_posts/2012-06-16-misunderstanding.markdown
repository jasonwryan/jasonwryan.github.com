I am frequently struck by how many people arrive on the 
[Arch boards](https://bbs.archlinux.org/ 'Arch Linux Forums') without *any* 
understanding of how Arch is different from the other GNU/Linux communities 
they may have spent time with (if, indeed, they have spent any time in
another community before trying Arch). For me, this is akin to arriving in a 
foreign country and not bothering to familiarize yourself at all with the local
mores and customs; it lies on a spectrum somewhere between ignorance and
outright arrogance. 

The result, inevitably, is that these people are shocked
when their expectations of how they *should* be treated are at odds with the
reception their behaviour invites…

Before venturing any further, I should preface my remarks about this with
something of a disclaimer. These are my own views and not those of the current,
or past, forum staff.

One of Arch's significant acheivements is the quality of
[its documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org 'THE best GNU/Linux Wiki').
Not just the technical documentation describing how to install and configure
Arch, but the cultural documentation that sets out
[Arch's philosophy](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way 'The Arch Way')
and [standards of behaviour](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Forum_Etiquette
'Forum Etiquette'). Both these pages provide clear statements on what to expect when
using Arch Linux and a clear indication of how to respectfully interact with the
community when you are seeking help.

The defining statement about Arch's intended user base is quite direct and 
unambiguous:

{% blockquote The Arch Way https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way#User-centric %}
Arch Linux targets and accommodates competent GNU/Linux users 
by giving them complete control and responsibility over the system.
{% endblockquote %}

The expression “targets and accommodates” doesn't exclude other users—for
example, those that are not necessarily competent, but are wanting to learn
more about the specifics of how their machines work—it does, however, signal
quite explicitly what sort of community Arch is. And what it is not.

[Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com 'Ubuntu Linux') is an excellent distribution. Like Arch,
it has very specific aims and a clear concept of what the Ubuntu community is.
Popularity is central to Ubuntu's culture. People coming from Ubuntu, who
haven't bothered to familiarize themselves with Arch's values, often struggle
to appreciate the difference; leading to comments like this one:

{% blockquote Linux Journal commenter http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/arch-way#comment-361974 %}
Maybe if Arch is friendly and Arch forum is friendly, it might go some
place, who knows…
{% endblockquote %}

This was posted in reply to a post on Arch in which the author noted how to 
seek help with Arch Linux:

{% blockquote http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/arch-way %}
You'll find far less hand-holding on the Arch Forums than some of the other
distro's forums, and for good reason.  Arch has one of the most informative,
user-friendly wiki's out there. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT ask a question in the
forums or on IRC without searching the wiki and the forums first.
{% endblockquote %}

Similarly, looking through the threads in 
[Newbie Corner](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewforum.php?id=23 'Newbie board')
will periodically turn up new posters who are indignant at being told to
<acronym title="Read The Fscking Manual">RTFM</acronym> and see it as some
sort of *personal* attack, when in fact it is just someone pointing out the
obvious to them. The community hasn't compiled all that documentation just
so they can sit around and regurgitate answers for people who are either
unwilling or incapable of making the minimum amount of  effort required to 
solve their own problems…

If you want handholding, there are plenty of online communities that will
cater for you. If you install Arch and think that you are automatically entitled
to immediate support for issues that you encounter, then you are mistaken.
If you think that Arch will suffer if you don't get what you want, then
your problems extend significantly beyond your choice of distro.

The community has worked hard over the years to keep the signal-to-noise ratio
on the boards high, that way, the forums remain a helpful resource for the community,
not a breeding ground for
[help vampires](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/03/17/vampires/ 'Post on parasites…').
