I have posted about using [dropbox](http://dropbox.com 'dropbox homepage') quite
[a few times](https://duckduckgo.com/?sites=jasonwryan.com&q=dropbox 'DDG search results')
over the last couple of years; it is one of those utilities that quickly insinuates itself
into an indispensable niche in your workflow and, consequently, can be *very* difficult to
dislodge. Perhaps because it has started to glue together so much of the way I work, I have 
been wondering when I would find a replacement that would deliver all, or much, of the 
functionality, without the standard 
[cloud security issues](http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/07/dropbox-confirms-it-got-hacked-will-offer-two-factor-authentication/ 'Ars post on the dropbox hack'),
that seem to bedevil these services.<sup>1</sup>

When I saw that BitTorrent had release a distributed synching app called—appropriately—
[Sync](http://blog.bittorrent.com/2013/01/24/test-bittorrent-sync-pre-alpha/ 'Blog post on sync release'),
I [signed up for the Alpha](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html 'Invitation form') and
have been running it in lieu of dropbox for the past three weeks. My initial reaction is, 
that for a first release, it is very impressive.

Essentially, Sync uses the 
[bittorrent peer-to-peer protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittorent 'Wikipedia entry')
and encryption 
([AES 256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aes_256 'Wikipedia entry on the standard')
using a private key based on the secret generated for each shared folder) 
to sync files between your machines—or anyone with whom you share the secret 
for a particular directory. This has several advantages over dropbox, from my perspective. 
First and foremost, you are not relying on some third party for security<sup>2</sup>, storage
and uptime. Secondly, all of the traffic between your devices is encrypted. And finally,
it is free (sadly, only as in beer).

### Positives
So what does it do well? It is ridiculously easy to setup. You download the binary, start 
the app and then (on Linux) use the web interface to setup your first synching folder by
generating a secret and then nominating a folder to share. On your next machine, enter the
secret and select or create the shared folder and your files will be synched. Done.

On a headless machine, there is a config file that you can create:

{% codeblock lang:sh %}
syncapp --dump-sample-config > syncapp.conf
{% endcodeblock %}

Edit it to suit your requirements, and then start `syncapp` with that configuration:

{% codeblock lang:sh %}
syncapp --config /path/to/syncapp.conf
{% endcodeblock %}

and you are away, happily synching.

Like other applications that use the bittorrent protocol, it can take a minute or
two for the synching to begin, but once it does I found it—over the Internet as well
as my <acronym title="Local Area Network">LAN</acronym> to be much faster than
dropbox. Another plus.

### Areas for improvement
It is Alpha software so there are some areas where you can expect to see improvements
with subsequent release. For me, that includes:

* Better command line tools; the current limited set are servicable, but could do
with more flexibility and options
* The ability to create your own secret, rather than rely on generated ones
* A less fragile config file; it is written in JSON and the simplest errors will 
break it
* More Linux love; the other platforms have a much more sophisticated <acronym title="User Interface">UI</acronym>

A comparison with dropbox is not entirely fair; there are some things that dropbox
does—like versioning—that Sync can/will not do. Dropbox also allows you to host
public files and folders, meaning that you can
[setup a basic webpage](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/01/11/using-dropbox-to-share-dotfiles/ 'Post on using dropbox to host dotfiles')
or [share a photo album](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t6ko1rbl9edy8p4/OkwVLtY5fO 'My Top 10 Albums').
Sync clearly isn't designed for this.

However, in some other respects, like architectures
for example, Sync is already a better choice. The ARMv6 port means that I am able 
to run it on my Raspberry Pi, and that I have been able to update my 
[IRC notification system](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2011/11/07/irc-dzen/ 'Post on IRC highlights')
to use Sync rather than dropbox and it is working perfectly well.

There is one area, though, where I wish the BitTorrent team would be a lot more
forthcoming. There has been an unanswered question on the Sync forums for 
over three weeks now asking
[will Syncapp be open sourced?](http://forum.bittorrent.com/topic/8816-will-syncapp-be-open-source/ 'Syncapp Forums')
Aside from the issue of whether or not the source will be made available (and I am guessing
that given their reticence to answer the question on their boards the prognosis
is not promising) people using the application now should know under what terms
they are using it. 

In the absence of any definitive licensing, I can only assume that the application
is covered by BitTorrent's 
[default EULA](http://www.bittorrent.com/legal/eula 'Licensing agreement on BitTorrent site').
That ambiguity means that I am happy to participate in the
trial and provide feedback, but I won't be using the app for any remotely 
sensitive data and I am unlikely to do so until that issue is clarified.

I'll install [Sparkleshare](http://sparkleshare.org/ 'Sparkleshare site')
and give that a shot instead…

#### Notes
1. Naturally, there are more issues at play here than just their (in)security policies.
2. Assuming, of course, you trust what BitTorrent pack into the binary…
