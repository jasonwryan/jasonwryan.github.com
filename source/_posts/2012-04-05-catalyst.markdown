After eight years as a bureaucrat<sup>1</sup> working in a 
[central agency](http://ssc.govt.nz "State Services Commission website") 
in New Zealand's public service, I have hung up the grey cardigan. 

While I am sure that I will never shed some of the qualities of being an 
official (think discretion and a belief in the importance of sound 
governance—rather than a keen ear for the rattle of the tea trolley), 
I am looking forward to the opportunity to stretch out a little<sup>2</sup>.

When I first joined the Commission, it was to work in the E-government Unit. I
was strongly attracted to a role that combined communications and technology
and, at the time, the EGU was the epicentre of a huge amount of really interesting 
initiatives. The 
[Open Source Policy](http://archive.ict.govt.nz/plone/archive/policy/open-source.1.html "Policy Paper in the egovernment archive"), 
the [Authentication Framework](http://archive.ict.govt.nz/plone/archive/services/authentication/library/docs/authentication-bpf/index.html "BPF in the egovernment archive"), 
work on [Digital Rights Management](http://archive.ict.govt.nz/plone/archive/policy/tc-and-drm/oldindex.html "TC & DRM paper in egovt archive") 
and [security](http://archive.ict.govt.nz/plone/archive/policy/trust-security/niip-report.1.html "Security in the egovt archive")
to name just a few; it was a geek's paradise (certainly from a policy perspective).

I have no doubt that the foundation of much of what I was later able to achieve 
was fostered in this environment; whether it was originally making the code available 
for the [e-government website](http://e.govt.nz "The original Plone site"),
[blogging about social media in the public sector](http://psnetwork.org.nz/blog/ "More than you would ever want to read on this…"),
working with the other public service communications managers on the
[Review of the Function](http://www.psnetwork.org.nz/resources-comms-function-review/ "A Review of the Communications Function in NZ Govt"),
or issuing the <acronym title="Request For Proposal">RFP</acronym> for the rebuild
of the SSC website with the stipulation that the solution had to be 
open source so that we could reuse it across government.

You can probably see a theme emerging here. If you have read this blog at all, you will
definitely see where this is heading…

Anyway, I am about to start focussing on technology—and open source technology in 
particular—on a full time basis. From the middle of this month, I join the team at 
[Catalyst](http://catalyst.net.nz/ "Catalyst homepage"), New Zealand's leading 
open source company, where I will be the newly minted Strategy and Relations Manager.

I'm thrilled to be able to work for a company that is dedicated to driving the uptake 
of open source by businesses and government. Both the 
[private](http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/03/red-hat-hits-a-billion-dollars-in-revenue-a-milestone-for-open-source.ars "Red Hat hits $1billion")
and [public sectors](http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/business-of-it/2012/03/22/iceland-swaps-windows-for-linux-in-open-source-push-40154870/ "Iceland dumps windows for Linux in the public sector")
around the world are really starting to grasp the strategic and economic benefits of using
open source; we are going to be doing our best to accelerate that adoption.


##### Notes
1. I have used the term proudly for the last eight years, and will continue to do so…
2. Yes, my [twitter stream](http://twitter.com/jasonwryan) will likely become a little more colourful.
