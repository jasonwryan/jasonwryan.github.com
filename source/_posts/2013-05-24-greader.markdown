I have been using [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_reader 'Wikipedi page')
everyday since I first discovered the service over seven years ago. It is my
primary source of news and information and the announcement that Google is, on July 1 this year,
set to [shut down Reader](http://googlereader.blogspot.ca/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html 'Official announcemet on Google Blog')
was something considerably more than just an inconvenience for me.

Over the years, I had looked at other <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> 
readers but, for a variety of reasons, had invariably found that the speed,
simplicity and flexibility that Google Reader offered meant that any dalliances
were unsatisfactory and short-lived. I resigned myself to having to settle for 
an inferior alternative, rather than moving to a genuine replacement.

On the recommendation of [@pinboard](https://pinboard.in/ 'Not so-social bookmarking'), 
I first signed up for a premium account at 
[NewsBlur](https://www.newsblur.com/ 'NewsBlur website'). It is open source and,
given the recommendation from Maciej<sup>1</sup>, I was hopeful that it would
bridge the gap. Newsblur is a good service (especially considering the rush of
signups in the days after the Google announcement), but it has a couple of
critical weaknesses for me: no search (yes, you read that correctly—there is *no
way to search through your feeds*) and, less importantly but just as annoying,
occasionally sluggish performance.

After a couple of weeks using NewBlur I happily stumbled across
[CommaFeed](https://www.commafeed.com/ 'CommaFeed homepage'), a
Reader clone that emulates the austere minimalism of Google Reader. Apart from
the fact that it is open source, the other aspect that attracted me to it 
was the ability to run it on Red Hat's Platform as a Service offering, 
[OpenShift](http://www.openshift.com/ 'Red Hat PaaS'). 

The README on the [Github repo](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed 'CommaFeed repo') 
explains how to set it all up. Unfortunately, due to an 
[open issue](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/issues/91 'OpenShift fails silently'), 
some manual intervention is required, but it is still a very
straightforward and painless process to get your own instance of CommaFeed up
and running.

Creat an OpenShift account, log in and add the JBoss 6.0 application (or
cartridge as it is called on OpenShift) and the MySQL cartridge. Once your setup
is created, add your public <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym> key and,
under your `My Applications` tab, copy down your Git repo address, which will be
of the form:

{% codeblock lang:sh %}
ssh://76758382475ef809976543@$appname-$namespace.rhcloud.com/~/git/feeds.git/
{% endcodeblock %}

Then you need to make a local clone of CommaFeed and push it to the Red Hat
server:

{% codeblock lang:sh %}
git clone https://github.com/Athou/commafeed.git
cd commafeed
# add OpenShift as a repo
git remote add openshift -f ssh://76758382475ef809976543@$appname-$namespace.etc…
git merge openshift/master -s recursive -X ours
git push openshift master
{% endcodeblock %}

This will then trigger a series of hooks that build the application and restart
the server. If everything goes well you will see something like:

{% codeblock lang:sh %}
remote: [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
remote: [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
remote: [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
remote: [INFO] Total time: 3:18.195s
remote: [INFO] Finished at: Mon May 20 03:21:37 EDT 2013
remote: [INFO] Final Memory: 42M/185M
remote: [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
remote: Running .openshift/action_hooks/build
remote: Running .openshift/action_hooks/deploy

remote: Running .openshift/action_hooks/post_deploy
To ssh://76758382475ef809976543@$appname-$namespace.rhcloud.com/~/git/feeds.git/
{% endcodeblock %}

You now have CommaFeed successfully running on OpenShift. After a couple of
minutes, visit the public <acronym title="Unique Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
and you will be able to login to your CommaFeed instance. Updating your 
CommaFeed is as simple as pulling to your local repo, merging and
then pushing to `openshift master`.

Importing directly from Google Reader still seems broken (I was  getting
errors from builds late this week), but if you import from an existing `.opml`
or `.xml` file you will see CommaFeed in all it's glory:

{% img left /images/post_images/commafeed_screen.png 'ComaFeed screenshot' %}

As you can see, it is remarkably similar to the Google Reader interface; a
clean, minimalist design that is focussed—quite rightly—on the content. There
is an option to load your own `.css` if you want to apply some additional
styling, but for me the base style is just about perfect.

More impressively, in the week or so that I have been using CommaFeed, the
developer, 
[Athou](https://github.com/Athou 'Athou on Github'), has been committing
enhancements and bug fixes several times *a day*; almost every night, 
I have pushed changes to OpenShift, reloaded my browser and found a 
smoother, enhanced feed reader with additional functionality; it is
literally growing in leaps and bounds, and is a great reminder of the power 
of open source<sup>2</sup>.

The performance of OpenShift has also been solid; feeds are delivered
seemingly instantaneously and, apart from the slight lag after restarting
the application, I haven't experienced any issues whatsoever in terms
of availability.

There are still a couple of areas where CommaFeed can be improved. Most
notably, there is an open feature request for a 
[mobile friendly CSS](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/issues/54 'Github Issue')
and this is badly needed, the site is pretty much unusable on my phone. With
any luck, some enterprising Android developer will build a CommaFeed app (for
which I would happily pay good money)…

In any event, if you are looking for a Google Reader replacement, try
running CommaFeed (either on your own server or one of Red Hat's); for
a project that is only a couple of months old, it has covered a 
tremendous amount of ground and will undoubtedly continue to grow
and improve. 

#### Notes
1. In conjunction with his great advice about not being a 
[free user](http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/ 'Pinboard blog').
2. The [about page](http://feeds-jwr.rhcloud.com/#/feeds/help 'About and Help page')
has a donate button: if you want to support an application which I have no doubt
will soon be even better than Google Reader, you might want to use it.
