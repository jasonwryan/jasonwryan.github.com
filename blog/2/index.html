Due to a rather embarrassing episode in #archlinux a couple of weeks ago,
where I naively shared one of the first bash scripts I had written without
first looking back over it<sup>1</sup>, and had to subsequently endure what
felt like the ritual
<a href="http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/2013-02-24/" title="Classic Dilbert strip">code mocking</a>,
but was in fact some helpful pointers as to how I could make the script suck
less (a <em>lot</em> less) I have been going through those older scripts and applying
the little knowledge that I have picked up in the interim; reappraising the
usefulness of the scripts as I go.</p>

<p>One that has proved to be of some utility for many years now is a simple
wrapper script I wrote to help manage my finances. Like many useful scripts, it
was written quickly and has been in constant use ever since; becoming almost
transparent it is so ingrained in my workflow.</p>

<p>The script allows me to manage the lag between when a company emails me an
invoice and when the payment is actually due. I find that companies will
typically email their invoices to me some weeks in advance, whereupon I will
make a mental note and then, unsurprisingly, promptly forget all about it,
thereby opening myself up for penalties for late payment.  It didn&rsquo;t take me
long (well, in my defence, a lot less time than it took for invoices to become
digital) to realise that there was a better way™ - a script.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/at.html" title="POSIX spec">at command</a>
is purpose built for running aperiodic commands at a later time (whereas
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html" title="POSIX spec">cron</a>
is for periodic tasks). So, using at(1), once I receive an invoice, I can set a
reminder closer to the final payment window, thereby avoiding both the late
payment penalty—and the loss of interest were I to pay it on receipt. I just
needed a script to make it painless to achieve.</p>

<p>The main function of the script is pretty self-explanatory:</p>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">fi</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, an invoice arrives, I open it and fire up
<a href="https://github.com/jasonwryan/dwm/blob/patches/patchset/Base_config_changes.patch#L85" title="patch on github">a scratchpad</a>, and follow the prompts. A couple of weeks later, the
reminder email arrives and I login to my bank account and dispatch payment.
You could, of course, have the script trigger some other form of notification,
but an email works well for me.</p>

<p>The rest of the script is similarly basic; just some options for listing and
reading any queued jobs and some more rudimentary checking. The full script is
in my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/centurion/src/tip/Scripts/todo" title="todo script">bitbucket repo</a><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<h3>Update 7/09/14</h3>

<p>Not more than a couple of hours after posting this,
<a href="http://bluewind.at/">Florian Pritz</a> pinged me in #archlinux with some great suggestions
for improving the script. I particularly liked relying on date(1) handling the input format
for the time and date values. He also suggested a
<a href="http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html" title="GNU readline page">readline</a>
wrapper called (appropriately enough)
<a href="https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap" title="Github repo">rlwrap</a> and a <code>tmpfile</code> to better manage
input validation. You can see his
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jasonwryan/54fead5ad2b0c3b82621" title="Gist on github">full diff</a> of
changes. In the end, I adopted the <code>date</code> suggestion but passed on <code>rlwrap</code>. Thanks for the
great pointers, Florian.</p>

One of the real strengths of Arch is its ability to be customised. Not just in
terms of the packages that you choose to install, but how those packages
themselves can be patched, altered or otherwise configured to suit your
workflow and setup. I have posted previously about,
for example, <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/03/29/vim/" title="Post on Vim configuration">building Vim</a>
or <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/05/18/pkgbuilds/" title="More general observations">hacking PKGBUILDS</a>.
What makes all this possible is the wonderful
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Build_System" title="Arch Wiki page">ABS</a>,
the Arch Build System.</p>

<p>Essentially a tree of all of the PKGBUILDs (and other necessary files) for the
packages in the official repositories, the ABS is the means by which you can
easily acquire, compile and install any of the packages on your system:</p>

<blockquote><p>ABS is made up of a directory tree (the ABS tree) residing under <span class="file">/var/abs</span>. This tree contains many subdirectories, each within a category and each named by their respective package. This tree represents (but does not contain) all <em>official Arch software</em>, retrievable through the SVN system.</p><footer><strong>Arch Wiki</strong> <cite>ABS</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I have been using ABS since I started running Arch and it has worked well. I
wrote a
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/tip/Scripts/abpkg" title="In my bitbucket repo">simple script</a>
to check for and download updates when required to help simplify the process
and have been generally content with that approach. That isn&rsquo;t to say that
elements of this process couldn&rsquo;t be improved. One of the small niggles is that
the ABS only syncs once a day so there is almost always—for me down here in
.nz, anyway—at least a full day&rsquo;s wait between the package hitting the local
mirror and the updated ABS version arriving. The other issue is that you
download and sync the entire tree…</p>

<p>That all changed when, at the start of this month, one of the Arch developers,
<a href="http://blog.falconindy.com/" title="Dave's blog">Dave Reisner</a>, opened a
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=185075" title="asp thread">thread on the Arch boards</a>
announcing <a href="https://github.com/falconindy/asp" title="Github repo">asp</a>, the Arch
Source Package management tool, a git-based alternative for <code>abs</code><sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>Basically a 200-line bash script, <code>asp</code> is an improvement over <code>abs</code> insofar as
you get the updated PKGBUILDs immediately; you can choose between just pulling
the necessary source files (as <em>per</em> <code>abs</code>), or checking out the package branch
so that you can create your own development branch and, for example, keep your
patch set in git as well.</p>

<p>You can elect to locate the local git repository in a directory of your
choosing by exporting <code>ASPROOT</code>, there are <kbd>Tab</kbd> completion scripts
for bash and zsh and a succinct <code>man</code> page. Overall, for a utility that is only
three weeks old, <code>asp</code> is already fulfilling the function of a drop-in
replacement; a faster, more flexible tool for building Arch packages from
source.</p>

After posting last week about
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2014/07/25/keepass/" title="Redundant blog post">KeePassC as a password manager</a>,
a couple of people immediately commented about a utility billed as “the
standard Unix password manager.” This is definitely one of the reasons I
continue to write up my experiences with free and open source software: as soon
as you think that you have learned something, someone will either offer a
correction or encourage you to explore something else that is similar, related
or interesting for some other tangential reason.</p>

<p>So, I was off down that path… Called simply <a href="http://www.passwordstore.org/" title="Homepage">pass</a>,
it is a 600 line bash script that uses
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard" title="Wikpedia entry">GPG encryption</a>
and some other standard tools and scripts to organize and manage your password
files. I had never heard of it but, based on Cayetano and Bigby&rsquo;s
recommendations, I thought it would be worth a look.</p>

<p>On of the reasons that I had not come across it before was that, after using
<a href="http://www.keepassx.org/" title="KeePassX homepage">KeePassX</a> for so long, I had
assumed that I would need to continue to use that database format; so when I
was looking for an alternative,
<a href="http://raymontag.github.io/keepassc/" title="KeePassC homepage">KeePassC</a>
was a natural fit (and a fine application). The question of migrating my data
hadn&rsquo;t even occurred to me…</p>

<p>It turns out that the migration process to pass is extraordinarily well catered
for: there are
<a href="http://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/importers" title="pass git repo">10 migration scripts</a>
for a range of different formats, including
<a href="http://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/importers/keepassx2pass.py" title="Said script…">keepassx2pass.py</a>,
which takes the exported <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym>
KeePassX database file and creates your pass files,ordered by the schema you
had used in that application.  You just need to make sure you amend the shebang
to <code>python2</code> before running the script, otherwise it will fail with an
unhelpful error message.</p>

<p>After using KeePassX to dump my database, before I could use the script to
create my pass directories, I had to export the <code>PASSWORD_STORE_DIR</code>
environment variable to place the top level pass directory in an alternate
location. This way, instead of initializing a git repository, I could have the
store synced by
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2014/05/10/syncthing/" title="My post on Syncthing">Syncthing</a>.
The git idea is a good one, but I&rsquo;m not particularly interested in version
controlling these directories, and I have no intention, encrypted or not, of
pushing them to someone else&rsquo;s server.</p>

<p>That constitutes the basic setup. It took a grand total of five minutes. The
real strength of pass, however, is in its integration with two other fantastic
tools:
<a href="http://www.funtoo.org/Keychain" title="Keychain homepage">keychain</a> and
<a href="http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/" title="Another quality Suckless product">dmenu</a>.
Together with pass, these constitute a secure, convenient and effortless
workflow for managing your passwords. With your GPG key loaded into keychain,
you are only prompted for your master passphrase once<sup>1</sup> and with
Chris Down&rsquo;s excellent
<a href="http://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/dmenu/passmenu" title="In the pass repo">passmenu script</a>,
you can use dmenu to sort through your password files, <kbd>Tab</kbd> complete
the one you are looking for and have it copied to your clipboard with a couple
of keystrokes.</p>

<p>After using Chris' script for a couple of days, I made a few alterations to
suit my setup: removed the <code>xdotool</code> stuff (as I don&rsquo;t need it), included dmenu
formatting options to match my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/tip/Scripts/dwm-status" title="In my bitbucket repo">dwm statusbar</a>
and, most significantly, changed the way that the files are printed in dmenu to
remove the visual clutter of the parent directories, ie., print <span class="file">archwiki</span>
as opposed to <span class="file">internet/archwiki</span>:</p>

<p>It does introduce some more complexity into the script, but it makes it a lot
easier for me to identify the desired password when reading it in dmenu.</p>

<p>Now, when I need a to enter a password, I hit my dmenu hotkey, type <code>dpass</code>
<kbd>Enter</kbd> and the first couple of letters of the desired password
filename, <kbd>Tab</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> and the password is loaded and ready
to go. There are also
<a href="http://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/src/completion" title="Git repo">completion scripts</a>
for the main shells, and even one for
<a href="http://fishshell.com/" title="Fish homepage">fish</a><sup>2</sup> for the iconoclasts…</p>

<p>While I have no complaints at all with KeePassC, I have found this pass setup to
be a lot less intrusive to use, it seamlessly integrates with my workflow,
and the passwords themselves are much simpler to manage. Short of someone else
popping up in the comments with another compelling proposition, I&rsquo;m content
with the way this has worked out. Many thanks to Cayetano Santos and Bigby
James for the push.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>There is a very annoying <a href="https://bugs.funtoo.org/browse/FL-69">bug open for keychain</a>
that means if, as I do, you start keychain from your <span class="file">$HOME/.profile</span>
or <span class="file">$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile</span> you <em>will</em> need to enter the same
passphrase to unlock a sub-key before you can use pass (the same thing applies
to Mutt).  This gets really ugly if you attempt to use dmenu before unlocking
your key…</li>
<li><q>Finally, a command line shell for the 90s…</q> Indeed.</li>
</ol>
