Late last month there was a post on
<a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/251758/why-is-stack-overflow-so-negative-of-late" title="All the hate…">Meta Stack Overflow</a> wondering why SO is “so negative of late.” Reading through the
extensive list of answers, and all the comments that quickly adhered to them
like barnacles on a becalmed schooner, it was hard not to extrapolate to the
experiences of online communities elsewhere, especially in the free and open
software world. Stack Overflow is going on six years old now and has grown to
be a truly formidable<sup>1</sup> resource for programmers, <em>dilettantes</em>—the
category to which I clearly belong—and, apparently, people wanting their
homework done for them. This isn&rsquo;t the first time this question has been raised
there, and I am sure it won&rsquo;t be the last.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t spend <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/712613/jasonwryan" title="My SO profile">much time on SO</a>,
mostly because I am not a programmer and so I don&rsquo;t have much to contribute there, but also because
I <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/users/6761/jasonwryan" title="U&amp;L profile">am active on Unix &amp; Linux</a><sup>2</sup>,
one of the clones that has emerged out of the metastasizing StackExchange
empire. I do, however, subscribe to quite a few of the <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym>
feeds for question tags on SO: things like #awk, #bash, and other topics that are of interest
to me. Given the amount of noise in these feeds; in the form of redundancy (ie., questions
that have been asked in one form or another <em>many</em> times before) or just a signal failure to read
<em>any</em> documentation, it is not surprising that the people responsible for this degradation
see the site as negative, or unfriendly, or elitist. This is perfectly natural: it is the
community attempting to defend itself from
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/03/17/vampires/" title="Post on the scourge">help vampires</a>.</p>

<p>What was also quite predictable, given StackExchange&rsquo;s response to this “problem” which was the
2012 <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/07/kicking-off-the-summer-of-love/" title="SE Blog post">Summer of Love</a>
campaign where they wanted to make SO a more friendly place, was that this would only
exacerbate the issue. My experience of the site over that time is that the signal to noise has
not improved at all, quite the contrary. I think that setting an expectation that the site
would be more welcoming has two perverse consequences: first, it validates the perceptions
of the newcomers about purported hostility, and in doing so signals to the existing community
that built the value of the site that their culture needs remediation. Secondly, it signals
more tolerance for behaviours that add no value to the community; so it is hardly surprising
to see those behaviours proliferate.</p>

<p>From time to time the Arch community faces exactly the same criticisms: we are unfriendly,
or elitist. I neither agree with these types of comments, nor am I particularly perturbed by
them. Arch is a small community of volunteers, in order to create an environment where people
who are willing and able to actively contribute, I think is important to ensure that there
are clearly articulated standards<sup>3</sup> and that they are maintained by the
community at large.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see any scope for increasing the community&rsquo;s tolerance for vampirism or the sort
of self-entitlement that has a sad habit of appearing from time-to-time:</p>

<blockquote> As for the Arch team and their lacking resources, let's take your point at face value.  Now, we've known what the problem is for almost four hours and no fix has been issued.</blockquote>


<p>There is some sort of “problem” that “we” have known about for <em>four hours</em> and
yet, inconceivably<sup>4</sup>, <em>nothing</em> has been done about it?</p>

<p>There is no bug report on the <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/" title="Flyspray">Arch tracker</a> so
I am not sure why the collective pronoun is warranted here, that quibble aside; in what
universe is this sort of petulance considered acceptable? The only reasonable response
to this sort of whining is to close the thread and ban the infractor and their progeny, who
will no doubt suffer from the same sort of genetic deficiencies, <em>in perpetuam</em>…</p>

<p>Clearly articulating, and enforcing, minimum standards of behaviour doesn&rsquo;t
make your community hostile or unfriendly; it establishes boundaries for people
that supports respectful collaboration and the effective ability of that
community to self-moderate.  People new to the community who take the time to
read the guidelines and observe how things work will have no problem
adapting<sup>5</sup>. It may not make you popular, but it will make a
significant contribution to the sustainability of the community and the levels
of engagement of those that do contribute and wish to continue doing so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/arrows.png" title="Creative Commons image" >
Following up on my post from last week, about using
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2014/04/05/calendar/" title="Check it out…">khal and mutt</a>,
where I covered off a couple of simple hacks to integrate command line
calendaring with <a href="http://www.mutt.org/" title="Mutt hompeage">Mutt</a>, I had been using
the main development branch of
<a href="https://github.com/geier/khal" title="Master branch on github">khal</a> which includes
syncing capability. However, as I was conversing with the developer, Christian,
around
<a href="https://github.com/geier/khal/issues/47" title="Issue on khal github repo">a bug report</a>,
he indicated that this functionality would be superseded by development in a
separate branch that uses
<a href="https://github.com/untitaker/vdirsyncer" title="Github repo">vdirsyncer</a> to
synchronise calendars.</p>

<p>As Christian intimated that this change would happen in the
<a href="https://github.com/geier/khal/issues/47#issuecomment-40175915" title="Relevant comment">very near future</a>,
and “js” had commented on my last post to the effect that it was working well, I
thought I should take a look for myself.</p>

<p>There are packages in the AUR for
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python2-vdirsyncer/" title="Grab it">vdirsyncer-git</a> and
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python2-argvard/" title="Same deal…">python2-argvard</a>
so you will just need to grab the khal branch that uses <code>vdirsyncer</code> as it&rsquo;s
syncing engine. I have thrown up a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jasonwryan/10949540" title="Nothing too flash…">PKGBUILD gist</a>,
or—as we are only talking about a couple of simple scripts—you could install the
complete set using
<a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/" title="Official documentation">pip</a>, the
Python package manager; in which case it would be a straightforward:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>sudo pacman -S python2-pip
</span><span class='line'>pip2 install --user git+https://github.com/geier/khal.git@vdir
</span><span class='line'>pip2 install --user vdirsyncer
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>…and then remember to make sure that <span class="file">$HOME/.local/bin</span>
is included in your <code>$PATH</code>.</p>

<p>I wanted to have vdirsyncer manage two of my calendars, my
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV" title="Wikipedia page">CalDav</a> work calendar and
a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar" title="Wikipedia, again…">iCalendar</a>
with all of the New Zealand public holidays. Configuring vdirsyncer to
successfully do this took me a <em>lot</em> longer than I would like to admit: a
combination of my ineptitude, a bug and a broken schema in the original
<span class="file">holidays.ics</span> that I wanted to use.</p>

<p>The <code>collections</code> variable in the config file merits a mention in this regard.
If you choose to use it, be aware that your <acronym title="Unique Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
will have this value appended to it, which may throw
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404" title="Wikipedia entry">a 404</a>. Using the
<code>DEBUG</code> verbosity level will identify this issue if you are struck by it.</p>

<p>Eventually, with the help of both Christian and Markus, the vdirsyncer
developer, I got it set up and running smoothly. I then just had to create
a <code>cron</code> job to sync my work calendar every two hours and it was done.</p>

<p>As you would expect with such a simple tool, there is not a lot to say, or do,
with vdirsycner. It runs on a similar model to
<a href="http://offlineimap.org/" title="Home page">OfflineIMAP</a>, in that it synchronises a
remote and local repository. There are a couple of nice touches: it will read
your credentials from <span class="file">$HOME/.netrc</span> so you don&rsquo;t have
to worry about sensitive information in plain text in yet another file, and there
is a <code>VDIRSYNCER_CONFIG</code> variable, so you can place the config file wherever it
suits.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/calendar.jpg" title="Creative Commons Calendar image" >
I have posted a few times now about how I use
<a href="http://www.mutt.org/" title="Mutt homepage">Mutt</a><sup>1</sup>, that most superlative
of email clients. Using a variety of different tools, I have
settled on an effective and satisfying workflow for managing both my personal
and professional email, with one glaring exception: calendaring. This, I should
stress, is not for want of trying. It is not necessarily a nagging concern in
terms of my personal use of email, but professionally it is a daily frustration.</p>

<p>Day after day, I receive a <em>lot</em> of meeting invitations and, when these show up
in my inbox they are, for all intents and purposes, unintelligble. Yes, with
careful scrutiny you can decypher the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar" title="Wikipedia entry">iCalendar files</a>, but
doing so is more likely to induce a seizure than a punctual appearance at an
important meeting. To get around this, I had been using a basic Awk script that
would parse the most important parts of the message and print them out. This was
working well enough until I started to receive invitations from people using
OSX. For some god-unknown reason, Apple&rsquo;s “interpretation” of the
standard<sup>2</sup> is different enough to those sent from Evolution and
Thunderbird that my script wouldn&rsquo;t successfully print some of the data (just
the start and end times of the meeting, nothing too important).</p>

<p>I started to try and expand the capability of the script and then realized that
I would be much better off seeing if someone else had solved this problem;
satisfactorily, that is.
<a href="https://github.com/terabyte/mutt-filters" title="Github fork of the repo">And they had</a>.
In a further delightful coincidence, the original author of the script,
<a href="https://github.com/martynsmith" title="Martyn's Github repo">Martyn Smith</a> is an
ex-colleague who, in 2004, first got me interested in Linux (thank you, Martyn).
Armed with this script and entries in <span class="file">$HOME/.mutt/{mailcap,muttrc}</span>
now, whenever I open a calendar invitation, the pertinent details are printed
out perfectly legibly. It&rsquo;s a small step, but an important one.</p>

<p>Next I started playing around with
<a href="http://lostpackets.de/khal/" title="khal homepage">khal</a>, a command line calendaring
application that uses
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV" title="Wikipedia page">CalDav</a> to sync to
calendar servers. It is described as being in “the early stages of development”
and that certainly is the case. Nonetheless, it is incredibly promising as—even
in this rudimentary form—it performs well and offers most of the basics that I
require. khal is simple to setup, does not have too many (python2) dependencies
and handles multiple calendars<sup>3</sup>. Yes, there are bugs, but nothing
grievous and the developer,
<a href="http://lostpackets.de/blog/" title="Christian's blog">Christian Geier</a>, is very
responsive and helpful<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://lostpackets.de/khal/pages/usage.html" title="Usage page">khal documentation</a>
gives you a pretty good idea of the current feature set. Set up your
<span class="file">khal.conf</span> with the calendars you want synched and then
you have two modes of interaction: directly via the command line or an
interactive mode invoked with <code>ikhal</code>. Both modes allow you to perform the basic
functions of adding, editing or deleting events.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post_images/khal.png" title="Simple screenshot of khal" ></p>

<p>While the interactive mode is very simple and straightforward, what I am most
excited about is the ability to add events from the command line, as per the
example in the documentation:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>khal --new 25.10. 16:00 18:00 Another Event :: with Alice and Bob
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I just needed to figure out a way to extract the relevant fields from the iCal
file and pass them to khal. My first attempt is unashamedly ugly, both in
conception and execution. However, I don&rsquo;t know Perl (and at this stage of my
life
<a href="https://twitter.com/jasonwryan/status/204660063669989376" title="Sad, but true…">I have run out of time to learn it</a>),
and it actually works. I
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/tip/Scripts/ical_filter.pl" title="In my bitbucket repo">modified</a>
Martyn&rsquo;s script to write to a temp file and then, for iCal events I want to
import to khal, I bound a key sequence in Mutt to a simple Awk
script<sup>5</sup>:</p>

<p>In <span class="file">$HOME/.mutt/muttrc</span>, I have

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Neither elegant nor imaginative, I know; but for a first attempt, it gets the
job done. If I did know any Perl, I am sure I would be able to avoid the
additional temp file and the need to reread the information before handing it
off to khal, but you work with the skills (or lack thereof) that you have.
Needless to say, patches are welcomed.</p>
