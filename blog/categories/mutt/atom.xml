Seeing as I have been focussing on my mail client, I thought I would round out the trifecta of
<a href="http://www.mutt.org/" title="mutt homepage">mutt</a> posts<sup>1</sup> with what I am assuming is the
final piece of the puzzle: searching <code>mutt's</code> maildirs. For a small to average size mailbox, <code>mutt's</code>
searching works fine, but as your mail volume grows this simple search doesn't really scale. That's
where the rather modestly named <a href="http://notmuchmail.org/" title="Notmuch website">Notmuch</a> comes into play.</p>

<p>It can be run as a standalone mail client, but you can also use it with <code>mutt</code> to provide
a ruthlessly efficient and fast search tool for your email. I had looked at it and
<a href="http://sup.rubyforge.org/" title="A console client for people with lots of mail">Sup</a>
a couple of years ago, but was spurred to do something about it this week when
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/chosig" title="Chosig on Twitter">Gunnar Lundström</a> pinged me on twitter and
suggested I check it out. So I did.</p>

<p>{% blockquote Notmuch website http://notmuchmail.org %}
"Not much mail" is what Notmuch thinks about your email collection. Even if you receive 12000
messages per month or have on the order of  millions of messages that you've been saving for decades.
Regardless, Notmuch will be able to quickly search all of it. It's just plain not much mail.
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<p>There was previously a
<a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2011/01/how_to_use_Notmuch_with_Mutt/">mutt-notmuch script</a>
for integrating the two, but the functionality was included upstream at the start of this year
so it is quite straightforward to set it up. There is a
<a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=36289" title="Arch User Repository package">package in the AUR</a>
but it is intended as the full mail client, complete with, <em>shudder</em>, emacs support amongst
other things. I have stripped out the uneeded bindings and included the relevant <code>perl</code> libraries in a
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/centurion/src/6ff0f252961f/Build/notmuch/PKGBUILD" title="…in my bitbucket repo">modified PKGBUILD</a>
if you just want the basic search with <code>mutt</code>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you'll need to step through it manually.</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
pacman -S perl perl-mailtools perl-mail-box perl-string-shellquote
cowerd notmuch perl-term-readline-gnu
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>As you will see from the PKGBUILD, you will need to copy the <code>notmuch-mutt</code> script
into your <code>$PATH</code>: you'll find it in <span class="file">contrib/notmuch-mutt/</span>.</p>

<p>There is a simple interative setup, which you can complete before running the index the first time:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
notmuch setup
notmuch new
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>The final step is to copy across the <code>mutt</code> macros included with the script:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
cat src/notmuch-0.13/contrib/notmuch-mutt/notmuch-mutt.rc >> $HOME/.mutt/muttrc
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Now, from within <code>mutt</code>, <kbd>F8</kbd>, <kbd>F9</kbd> and <kbd>F6</kbd> will respectively
search, create the relevant threads from search results, and tag mails with <code>notmuch</code>.</p>

<p>As I use <code>offlineimap</code> to retrieve my mail, I simply added <code>notmuch new</code> to the script that
runs as a <code>cron</code> job to synch my mail and <code>notmuch</code> reindexes all of my mail as soon as it arrives.</p>

<h3>Updated 27/5/12</h3>

<p>Two of the <code>mutt</code> macros that are shipped in <span class="file">contrib/notmuch-mutt/notmuch-mutt.rc</span>
do not work. I have written a patch to fix this and
<a href="http://notmuchmail.org/pipermail/notmuch/2012/011263.html" title="Patch on notmuch list">posted it to the ML</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>{% img left http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/mutt-1.png 'mutt logo' %}</p>

<p>Following on from my <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/04/21/lbdb/" title="Using mutt, LDAP and SSL">last post about mutt</a>,
I have been tinkering more with the most suckless of mail clients to
get it to deal with—of all things—<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>
emails. I will preface this post with a remark or two that amounts to a warning about
intemperate language, ranting and a generally cranky disposition: repeated contact with
email marketers can do that to you…</p>

<p>A further  brief digression is warranted here. HTML email is, without doubt,
evidence of the imminent end of civilized life as we know it; much like the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Places_in_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Golgafrincham" title="Wikipedia entry on HHGTTG">Golgafrincham diaspora</a>, it is attributable to a depraved cabal of marketing consultants
and provides the same level of social good as syphilis and fistulas. Suffice to say, it is a blight.</p>

<p>Sadly, it is a blight that I have to deal with. Up until now, I had done that by using the
excellent <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/" title="w3m homepage on sourceforge">w3m</a> to render
HTML as text in mutt itself. That is accomplished easily enough with an entry in
<span class="file">muttrc</span> and another in a <span class="file">mailcap</span> file.</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh ~/.mutt/muttrc %}
auto_view text/html                                      # view html automatically
alternative_order text/plain text/enriched text/html     # save html for last
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh ~/.mutt/mailcap %}
text/html; w3m -I %{charset} -T text/html; copiousoutput;
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>This works for 80 percent of the HTML email I get. It is enough to confirm that the mail is useless
and can be discarded. The other 20 percent, however, is slightly more problematic. The initial
view in w3m is enough to tell me that, due to the outstanding incompetence of the idiots that
generated the email, there <em>is</em> actually some information that is contained in the email that I need
to access <strong>but it is not viewable in a text browser.</strong></p>

<p>{% img left http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/mutt-2.png 'An example…' %}</p>

<p>For this special level of retardation, I need to be able to open the email in a graphical browser.
As I use vimprobable, that means sending the file to
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2011/06/26/using-vimprobable/" title="My post on Using vimprobable">vimprobable running in tabbed</a>. Fortunately, as you would expect with superior software,
<code>mutt</code> has a way of handling this gracefully. In mutt's extensive documentation, there is a
<a href="http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-5.html" title="Go and read it…">page on mutt's MIME support</a>
that details how to set up a graduated response to this pernicious issue:</p>

<p>{% blockquote mutt manual http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-5.html %}
In addition, you can use this with Autoview to denote two commands for viewing
an attachment, one to be viewed automatically, the other to be viewed
interactively from the attachment menu.
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<p>So, you can have <code>mutt</code> render the HTML abomination in <code>w3m</code> in most cases, and when those
instances of particularly cretinous behaviour make it to your inbox, you can choose to
view them in your web browser. In my case, by altering the <span class="file">mailcap</span>
entry to look like this:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
text/html; vimprobtab.sh %s &; test=test -n "$DISPLAY"; needsterminal;
text/html; w3m -I %{charset} -T text/html; copiousoutput;
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>The first entry tests that X is running, and if it is, it hands the file to <code>vimprobable</code>. The
default, however, is determined by the <code>copiousoutput</code> tag. So, in <code>mutt</code> it is just a matter
of hitting <kbd>v</kbd> to view the attached HTML and then <kbd>m</kbd> to send it to <code>mailcap</code>.
For convenience, I bind <kbd>Enter</kbd> to that function in <span class="file">muttrc</span>:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
bind attach <return>    view-mailcap
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>{% img left http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/addressbook.png 'Address Book Icon by bertop on Flickr' %}</p>

<p>One of the great things about starting a new job at
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/04/05/catalyst/" title="My post on joining Catalyst IT">an open source company</a>
is having the freedom to use the tools that suit your workflow, rather than
having to suffer the indignity of whatever the IT department consider to be the
lowest comon denominator. Suffice to say, I have had a lot of fun this week
setting up my working environment—and the ocassional hiccough as I was forced to learn
something new…</p>

<p>One of those “learning opportunities” consisted of trying to get my mail client,
<a href="http://www.mutt.org/" title="All mail clients suck. This one just sucks less.">mutt</a>
to talk to the <acronym title="Lightweight Directory Acces Protocol">LDAP</acronym>
directory over <acronym title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</acronym> so that I could
query the shared address book. There are a number of helpful blog posts that describe
using <a href="http://www.spinnaker.de/lbdb/" title="The Little Brother Database homepage">lbdb</a>
with <code>mutt</code><sup>1</sup>. Unfortunately, after a lot of searching, I was unable to find
any documentation on achieving this integration over a secure connection.
I kept seeing this error:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
Error: Search failed. LDAP server returned an error : 13, description: TLS
confidentiality required at /usr/lib/mutt_ldap_query line 198, <DATA> line 558.
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Several hours later, and with some
help from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ibeardslee" title="Ian on Twitter: follow him…">@ibeardslee</a>,
I managed to set it up, and it was definitely worth the effort.</p>

<p>You will need to install <code>lbdb</code> from
<a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=10225" title="AUR package">the AUR</a>:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
cowerd lbdb     # 2
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>…and a couple of packages from the repos to make it all work:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
pacman -S perl-ldap perl-io-socket-ssl netkit-bsd-finger
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Then it is a matter of configuring <code>lbdb</code> to both
query the LDAP directory and be able to be called from <code>mutt</code>.
First, copy the config files into your <span class="file">$HOME</span>:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
mkdir .lbdb
cp /etc/lbdb.rc .lbdb/lbdbrc
cp /etc/lbdb_ldap.rc .lbdb/ldap.rc
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>And then modify the two configuration files to suit your setup:
The first, <span class="file">$HOME/.lbdb/lbdbrc</span>, is well commented and
self-explanatory; add <code>ldap</code> to the methods and the
nickname of your server:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
METHODS="m_abook m_ldap"
LDAP_NICKS="catalyst"
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>The second config file, <span class="file">$HOME/.lbdb/ldap.rc</span>
is written in Perl and is a bit of a shocker:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:perl %}
%ldap_server_db = (</p>

<pre><code>'catalyst' =&gt; ['ldaps://ldap.catalyst.net.nz:636',
                'ou=Staff,ou=People,dc=catalyst,dc=net,dc=nz',
                'givenname sn cn mail', 'givenname sn cn mail',
                '${mail}', '${givenname} ${sn}']
</code></pre>

<p>);</p>

<h1>hostname of your ldap server</h1>

<p>$ldap_server = 'ldaps://ldap.catalyst.net.nz:636';
$search_base = 'ou=Staff,ou=People,dc=catalyst,dc=net,dc=nz';
$ldap_search_fields    = 'givenname sn cn mail';
$ldap_expected_answers = 'givenname sn cn mail';
$ldap_result_email     = '${mail}';
$ldap_result_realname  = '${givenname} ${sn}';
$ignorant = 0;
$ldap_bind_dn = '';
$ldap_bind_password = '';
1;
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>The key is to ensure that you use both the <code>ldaps</code>
prefix <strong>and</strong> explicitely specify the SSL port, 636. Without both of these, you will
get the TLS confidentiality error.</p>

<p>You can then test that it is working correctly by running a query:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
lbdbq jemima
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>All going well, if there is indeed a Jemima in the shared address book, you will see her
contact details miraculously appear before you. If there is more than one, you will have a
list to choose from.</p>

<p>Finally, you just need to set up <code>mutt</code> to query <code>lbdb</code>.
In your <span class="file">muttrc</span>, add the following:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
set query_command = "lbdbq %s 2>/dev/null"
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>I found that suppressing the errors made the whole experience a little smoother. You
may not require it… Now, hitting <kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>q</kbd> in <code>mutt</code>
brings up a prompt to query the LDAP directory (and my <a href="http://abook.sourceforge.net/" title="abook homepage">abook</a> address book that I share via
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" title="Dropbox homepage">dropbox</a>). You can also access the directory
by starting to type an email address and then hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>t</kbd> to see
a list of possible completions.</p>
