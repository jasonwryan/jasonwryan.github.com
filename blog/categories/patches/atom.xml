<p>I had posted <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/2009-12-19-patching-dwm-with-pertag-and-bstack" title="Patching dwm with pertag &amp; bstack">a while back</a>
about my (failed) attempt to patch <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org" title="dwm homepage">dwm</a>
with both pertag and some of the other layout patches. I had been able to get it to work with
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/bottom_stack" title="dwm wiki: bstack">bottomstack</a>,
but adding another patch caused some of the chunks to fail. It seems
pertag moves the code around to the point that – using
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/" title="patches: dwm wiki">the standard patching method</a> –
any further patches won’t take.</p>

<p>Further investigation, and some trial and a tolerable amount of error,
have however demonstrated to me that it is quite possible to patch dwm
to your heart’s content; or at least to my meagre needs. Which in the
case of <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Configs/index.html" title="EeePC configs">my EeePC</a>
is pertag, cycle and push, with the addition of bstack on
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/workstation/src/" title="Workstation configs">my workstation</a>.</p>

<p>The solution, as I have found in almost every instance of my tinkering
with dwm, is stunningly simple. Start with a new version of dwm and
apply the
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag" title="dwm wiki: pertag">pertag diff</a>. Then
manually add all of the chunks of the subsequent patches.</p>

<p>All of the changes are now in dwm.c and your config.h should only have
the necessary keybindings to activate the functionality you have added
to this amazing window manager.</p>

<p>If you want to see what changes this makes, you can take a peek at
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/workstation/src/tip/dwm-5.7.2-2/" title="diff in mercurial repo">my .diff</a>
(for bstack, cycle, pertag and push). You are equally welcome to apply
it if that is the functionality that you are looking for in 5.7.2.</p>
