    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/notes.jpg" title="'Notepad image on Flickr'" >
Nearly two years ago, I posted about my adaption of a simple
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/09/28/command-line-notes/" title="My post in 2010">command line note utility</a>.
I have used this setup on all of my machines on a daily basis since and it has worked
marvellously. Symlinking to a folder in
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home" title="Dropbox home">Dropbox</a> means that the notes are accessible
from all my machines, including my phone. There has only really been one aspect of this setup
that has been sub-optimal.</p>

<p>As an inveterate note-taker (this is one of the “benefits” of ageing; the speed with
which you forget information outpaces the acquisition of newer material) I have—in
those intervening years—built up quite a store of notes. Consequently, in order to
maintain a semblance of order, I have arranged them in a series of directories. There
is a minor flaw with this approach: retreiving a note depended on two factors, a) excellent
recall<sup>1</sup> and, b) accurately typing out the full path. Neither of these are things that I
am inherently good at or inclined to master.</p>

<p>This had been irritating me for some time before I came across this
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/11906/how-to-change-the-target-directory-for-tab-completion" title="Tab completion for notes function">question on Unix &amp; Linux StackExchange</a>.
This provided me with a partial solution to the issue but, as I note in my answer, I was not
able to solve it for nested directories, which was my particular use case. Once I had
muddled my way through the solution on U&amp;L I pushed it to the back of my mind and
tried to ignore it.</p>

<p>Recently, though, the accumulation of notes and the frustration of trying to access them
without <kbd>Tab</kbd> completion drove me to do something about it.</p>

<p>The documentation on
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion-Builtins.html" title="Bash Manual">programmable completion</a>
is typically terse and searching the web returns very little in the way of instructions
as to how to accomplish this.<sup>2</sup> Undeterred, I decided to hack up a completion
function that worked for nested directories.</p>

<p>What I arrived at was this:
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">shopt</span> -s globstar
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">shopt</span> -s progcomp&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;n<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="nv">$EDITOR</span> <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.notes/<span class="s2">&quot;$*&quot;</span>.txt ;<span class="o">}</span>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt; <span class="c"># completion for notes</span>
</span><span class='line'>_notes<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">local </span>cur
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nv">cur</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">COMP_WORDS</span><span class="p">[COMP_CWORD]</span><span class="k">}</span>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;files<span class="o">=(</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.notes/**<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">file</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;${files[@]##*/}&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">COMPREPLY</span><span class="o">=(</span> <span class="k">$(</span> <span class="nb">compgen</span> -f <span class="s2">&quot;${file[@]}&quot;</span> -- <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">cur</span><span class="k">}</span> <span class="k">)</span> <span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;<span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">complete</span> -o default -F _notes n
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The best that can be said about it is that it <em>nearly</em> works…<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Realising that I was completely out of my depth, I turned to #bash for help, and
I was indeed fortunate that
<a href="https://github.com/geirha" title="geirha's Gitgub">geihra</a> offered some much needed
assistance. geirha's solution is an elegant one:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>n<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;_notes<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">local </span><span class="nv">files</span><span class="o">=(</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.notes/&lt;em&gt;*/<span class="s2">&quot;$2&quot;</span>&lt;/em&gt;<span class="o">)</span>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;<span class="o">[[</span> -e <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">files</span><span class="p">[0]</span><span class="k">}</span> <span class="o">]]</span> &amp;amp;&amp;amp; <span class="nv">COMPREPLY</span><span class="o">=(</span> <span class="s2">&quot;${files[@]##~/.notes/}&quot;</span> <span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">complete</span> -o default -F _notes n
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>In addition to working exactly as I hoped, it had the benefit of introducing me
to a couple more bash concepts that I hadn't encountered;
<a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Arrays" title="Bash Guide on Greg's Wiki">adding elements to an array</a>
with <code>+=()</code> being one. For posterity, the full script is:</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>The alternative to remembering the full path name is to list all of the notes before
each operation with the <code>nls</code> function; this is not ideal either…</li>
<li>Which means that it is either so straightforward that few have bothered to write up their
experiences (most likely), or so arcane that not many have bothered (how it
feels to me). However, there are a couple of pages that I referenced in addition
to the official documentation:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion-Builtins.html">Adam Backstrong's post</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fahdshariff.blogspot.co.nz/2011/04/writing-your-own-bash-completion.html">Fahd Shariff's post</a></li>
<li><a href="http://devmanual.gentoo.org/tasks-reference/completion/index.html">Gentoo Development Guide</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It fails, as geirha pointed out, because it breaks the filenames on whitespace.</li>
</ol>

    <link href="http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2012/03/30/octopress/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-30T12:30:00+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2012/03/30/octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/octopress_logo.png" width="240" height="240" title="Octopress Logo" ></p>

<p>Over the last week I have been moving my blog over to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>,
a lightweight blogging framework for <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>,
the static site generator powering <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. I had previously
been posting to a <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a> page and, over the nearly four years that
I had been doing that I had somehow racked up just over 4000 posts. I was <em>not</em>
looking forward to migrating across.</p>

<p>However, the fact that the Jekyll project has a number of scripts for
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations">migrating from other platforms</a>
assuaged my concerns about the difficulty of this task. That sense of relief was shortlived.
Neither of the two tumblr migration scripts were of any assistance: both would die during their
initial runs, probably due to some funky characters in the post titles, or perhaps the posts themselves.</p>

<p>I certainly had no intention of trying to wade through the entire back catalogue identifying the
rogue posts. Rather that admit defeat, and probably more due to a sense of misguided optimism about the
“straightforward” nature of the task, I saw this setback as an opportunity to cull all of the
cruft<sup>1</sup> from the blog and decided to manually import the fifty posts that I thought were of
some interest.</p>

<p>Being an assiduous record keeper, all of the posts were helpfully bookmarked on
<a href="https://pinboard.in/u:jasonwryan/t:jwr/">Pinboard under one tag</a>, and therefore it was
simple enough to create a list of the required <acronym title="Unique Resource Locator">URLs</acronym>.
Armed with this list, it was just a matter of cobbling together a script to do the bulk of
the work for me.</p>

<p>The first task was to retrieve the posts from the list:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1&gt;grab files&lt;/h1&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;while <span class="nb">read </span>url; <span class="k">do</span>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget --adjust-extension <span class="s2">&quot;${url}&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;done &amp;lt; /home/jason/Scripts/list
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Then I needed to remove all of the <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>
surrounding the actual posts: an <code>awk</code> one-liner took care of that.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1&gt;strip HTML cruft&lt;/h1&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;for file in &lt;em&gt;.html; <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">  </span>awk <span class="s1">&#39;/&lt;h3&gt;/ {flag=1;next} /&amp;lt;\/div&gt;/{flag=0} flag {print}&#39;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$file&quot;</span> &gt; <span class="s2">&quot;${file%%.&lt;/em&gt;}&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">done</span>
</span><span class='line'>mkdir html &amp;amp;&amp;amp; mv *.html html/
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The final task of this part of the migration was to convert the HTML into
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>,
the format that Octopress uses. <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>
the "universal document converter" handled that job:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1&gt;convert to markdown format&lt;/h1&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;for file in *; <span class="k">do</span>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandoc -f html -t markdown <span class="s2">&quot;$file&quot;</span> &amp;gt; <span class="s2">&quot;$file&quot;</span>.md
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;done
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The final result was fifty markdown files holding all of my posts, almost ready to
be committed to github. I say “almost” because the files still required what turned out to
be a reasonable amount of cleaning up. Pandoc did a great job, for example, but would
inexpicably break <a href="http://www.notareallink.com">multi word
hyperlinks</a> over two lines. Similarly all of the internal
links to my other posts pointed to the (meaningless) tumblr URLs<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Setting up Octopress was extremely simple and quick by comparison: the
<a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">documentation is very helpful</a>. There was one slight
hitch, a <a href="https://github.com/tmm1/pygments.rb/issues/10">known issue on Arch x86_64</a>,
which was simple enough to deal with.</p>

<p>While the migration was not entirely pain-free, I am pleased that I have done it. Tumblr's service
increasingly <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jasonwryan/statuses/176543962276954112">left a lot to be desired</a>
but as it was a free service, I couldn't complain too much. Or, more accurately, when I did complain,
no-one actually listened…</p>

<p>Indeed, moving to a paid service like Github
(yes, it's free at first, but once you have enough data there you need to pay a small amount
every month) <a href="http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/">makes a lot of sense</a>.
The paid services I do use, like <a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> and
<a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap</a> are both inexpensive and much more
reliable than their free counterparts<sup>3</sup>; and you get to invest in great
software that is a pleasure to use.</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>

<ol>
<li>Initially, I had set up the site as a simple holding page and dumped a whole lot
of feeds into it: twitter, bookmarks, scrobbled music, etc. Those 4000 posts were
mostly just that sort of internet detritus…</li>
<li>For creating redirections (Github pages do <em>not</em> support <span class="file">.htaccess</span>)
I can't recommend enough the
<a href="https://github.com/rawsyntax/jekyll_alias_generator/blob/master/_plugins/alias_generator.rb">Jekyll Alias Generator</a>.
Just. Brilliant.</li>
<li>And <strong>much</strong> more scrupulous about how they use your personal data.</li>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Simple aurphan notifier]]></title>
    <link href="http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2012/03/09/aurphan/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-09T16:52:00+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2012/03/09/aurphan</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/aurphan.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>If you are an Arch Linux user and you are not using
<a href="http://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/aurphan/" title="aurphan package details">aurphan</a>,
you can take a moment to hang your head in shame before you click on to
whatever the next thing is. The package description sums up perfectly
what aurphan does:</p>

<blockquote><p>Finds packages in need of maintainers, bug fixes and patches. Adopt
today!</p></blockquote>

<p>Running <code>aurphan -a</code>, for example, will identify any
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/" title="Arch User Repository">AUR packages</a> in your
database that are not currently maintained; allowing you to log in to
the AUR and hit the ‘Adopt’ button, leaving you feeling all worthy and
fulfilled.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>If, like most Archers, you have a compulsive desire to automate
<em>everything</em> then clearly typing (or even remembering to type) <code>aurphan
-a</code> into a terminal periodically is as ludicrous as it is onerous. The
obvious answer is some shell script and a cron job.</p>

<p>First, the <code>cron</code> job:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>crontab -e
</span><span class='line'>@hourly aurphan -a &gt;/tmp/aurphans
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Then, as part of my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/241da582a0fd/Scripts/dwm-status" title="Script in mercurial repo">dwm-status script</a>,
a function to check that there are no new additions to the file and, if
there are, flash a highlight:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>aur<span class="o">(){</span>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;aurphans<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;$(awk &#39;$0 !~ /^No /&#39; /tmp/aurphans | wc -l)&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="nv">$aurphans</span> -gt 0 <span class="o">]</span>; <span class="k">then</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">    </span><span class="nb">echo</span> -en <span class="s2">&quot;\x03*\x01&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">fi</span>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;<span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The awk filter excludes a null return, which is “No aurphans found.”
Now, if any of the packages that I use from the AUR are disowned, I’ll
be the first to know about it.</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>

<ol>
<li>Actual feeling may differ depending on the package you have adopted
and the amount of prescription painkillers that you are currently
ingesting…</li>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Logging Straight Into X]]></title>
    <link href="http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2011/12/18/login/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-18T22:13:00+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2011/12/18/login</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/login.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I have been using
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CDM" title="Arcjh Wiki entry on CDM">CDM</a>
to log into X on my Arch machines and, if I were to continue to require
the ability to access different window managers with any frequency, I
would use this approach. However, on my EeePC, I really only ever login
to a <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/" title="dwm at suckless.org">dwm</a> session or
the console, so having a login manager seemed like an unnecessary step.</p>

<p>Consequently, over the weekend, with the help of the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Start_X_at_Boot" title="Arch Linux wiki entry">Start X at Boot</a>
article on the Arch Wiki, I removed CDM and arrived at a secure,
flexible approach to logging into X (or the console).</p>

<p>My <span class="file">/etc/inittab</span> already boots me into runlevel 5:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1&gt;Boot to X11&lt;/h1&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;id:5:initdefault:
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>So it was just a case of putting a couple of lines in the correct
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Bash-Startup-Files" title="GNU Bash reference: startup files">invocation file</a>.
I chose <span class="file">$HOME/.bash_profile</span> because I only use Bash; if you use another
shell you should probably go with <span class="file">$HOME/.profile</span>. The recommended lines
from the Arch Wiki are:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> -z <span class="nv">$DISPLAY</span> &amp;amp;&amp;amp; <span class="k">$(</span>tty<span class="k">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> /dev/tty1 <span class="o">]]</span>; <span class="k">then</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">  </span><span class="nb">exec </span>startx
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c"># Could use xinit instead of startx</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c">#exec xinit -- /usr/bin/X -nolisten tcp vt7</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">fi</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>…and this works as advertised. If you are in TTY1 and you login, X is
started. The disadvantage for me, though, was that when you shutdown,
you must manually change to TTY7 (if that is your last
<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Remote-Serial-Console-HOWTO/getty-agetty.html" title="agetty remote serial console">agetty</a>)
to see the shutdown messages.</p>

<p>After rummaging around through various man and web pages, I finally
alighted on this helpful option: <code>-novtswitch</code>. So, my entry to start X
now looked like:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1&gt;startx <span class="k">if </span>on tty1&lt;/h1&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;if <span class="o">[[</span> -z <span class="s2">&quot;$DISPLAY&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span> &amp;amp;&amp;amp; <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="k">$(</span>tty<span class="k">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> /dev/tty1 <span class="o">]]</span>; <span class="k">then</span>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;exec xinit -- :0 -novtswitch &amp;amp;&amp;gt;/dev/null &amp;amp;
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">logout</span>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;fi
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Now, on shutdown and reboot, I see all of the shutdown messages. All
that remained was to add an option to log into a tmux session if I
didn’t want to use X. The final code looks like this:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>~/.profile </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1&gt;startx <span class="k">if </span>on tty1 and tmux on tty2&lt;/h1&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;if <span class="o">[[</span> -z <span class="s2">&quot;$DISPLAY&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span> &amp;amp;&amp;amp; <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="k">$(</span>tty<span class="k">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> /dev/tty1 <span class="o">]]</span>; <span class="k">then</span>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;exec xinit -- :0 -novtswitch &amp;amp;&amp;gt;/dev/null &amp;amp;
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">logout</span>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;elif <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="k">$(</span>tty<span class="k">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> /dev/tty2 <span class="o">]]</span>; <span class="k">then</span>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;tmux -f <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.tmux/conf new -s secured
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;fi
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Logging in from TTY1 takes me into my dwm session, if I switch to TTY2 I
am logged into a tmux session with keychain running. To start consolekit
with dwm, I have this in my <span class="file">$HOME/.xinitrc</span>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">exec </span>ck-launch-session <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/Scripts/dwm-start.
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>You can see my full <span class="file">$HOME/.bash_profile</span> in
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/241da582a0fd/.profile" title="profile in mercurial repo">my mercurial repo</a>.</p>

<h4>Updated 4/2/12</h4>

<p>For various reasons, I moved my environment variables from <span class="file">$HOME/.bashrc</span>
into <span class="file">$HOME/.profile</span>; this meant that these variables were only inherited in
interactive shells if <code>xinit</code> was called with <code>exec</code>.</p>

<p>I have also ditched <code>consolekit</code> - for all of the processes it was
spawning, it actually wasn’t performing any critical functions; or
indeed any functions that I really needed at all…</p>

    <link href="http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2011/12/01/readline/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-01T18:43:00+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2011/12/01/readline</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/readline.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I recently threw caution to the wind and
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/changeset/765405e97e25" title="Bitbucket commit">changed my shell over to vi mode</a>.
I wanted to take advantage of the superior command editing ability that
this mode offered, and also to continue to bake vi[m] methods into every
aspect of my working environment.</p>

<p>The change has been relatively straightforward; the only issues I have
experienced are really just around a couple of keybinds that I had
become accustomed to in normal/Emacs mode:</p>

<ul>
<li><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>.</kbd>: to recall the last argument of the previous command(s)</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>l</kbd>: to clear the screen in <em>insert</em> mode</li>
</ul>


<p>The first, the ability to recall the final arguments of previous
commands was a showstopper for me: I really struggled without this.
Being able to recall a long file path and append it to a new command is
invaluable. Fortunately, there is the <code>yank-last-arg</code> command that does
exactly this. Why it is not bound by default in vi mode is beyond me…</p>

<p>The other was purely cosmetic, really. I am an inveterate clearer of the
screen—unless I am referring to something printed to stdout, I always
prefer to work at the top of the console.</p>

<p>In any event, with the
<a href="http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html#SEC13" title="GNU Readline Library">bindable readline commands</a>,
it was a trivial exercize to restore this functionality to my bash shell
in vi mode. I created <span class="file">$HOME/.inputrc</span>, and added the requisite binds:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>~/inputrc </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$include /etc/inputrc&lt;/p>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1>for vi mode&lt;/h1>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p>set editing-mode vi
</span><span class='line'>$if mode=vi&lt;/p>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p>set keymap vi-command&lt;/p>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1>these are for vi-command mode&lt;/h1>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p>"\e[A": history-search-backward            # arrow up
</span><span class='line'>"\e[B": history-search-forward             # arrow down
</span><span class='line'>"\ep": yank-last-arg                       # bind to Alt-p
</span><span class='line'>Control-l: clear-screen&lt;/p>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p>set keymap vi-insert&lt;/p>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1>these are for vi-insert mode&lt;/h1>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p>"\e[A": history-search-backward
</span><span class='line'>"\e[B": history-search-forward
</span><span class='line'>"\ep": yank-last-arg
</span><span class='line'>Control-l: clear-screen
</span><span class='line'>$endif</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>
