<p>After eight years as a bureaucrat<sup>1</sup> working in a
<a href="http://ssc.govt.nz" title="State Services Commission website">central agency</a>
in New Zealand's public service, I have hung up the grey cardigan.</p>

<p>While I am sure that I will never shed some of the qualities of being an
official (think discretion and a belief in the importance of sound
governance—rather than a keen ear for the rattle of the tea trolley),
I am looking forward to the opportunity to stretch out a little<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>When I first joined the Commission, it was to work in the E-government Unit. I
was strongly attracted to a role that combined communications and technology
and, at the time, the EGU was the epicentre of a huge amount of really interesting
initiatives. The

the <a href="http://archive.ict.govt.nz/plone/archive/services/authentication/library/docs/authentication-bpf/index.html" title="BPF in the egovernment archive">Authentication Framework</a>,
work on <a href="http://archive.ict.govt.nz/plone/archive/policy/tc-and-drm/oldindex.html" title="TC &amp; DRM paper in egovt archive">Digital Rights Management</a>
and <a href="http://archive.ict.govt.nz/plone/archive/policy/trust-security/niip-report.1.html" title="Security in the egovt archive">security</a>
to name just a few; it was a geek's paradise (certainly from a policy perspective).</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the foundation of much of what I was later able to achieve
was fostered in this environment; whether it was originally making the code available
for the <a href="http://e.govt.nz" title="The original Plone site">e-government website</a>,
<a href="http://psnetwork.org.nz/blog/" title="More than you would ever want to read on this…">blogging about social media in the public sector</a>,
working with the other public service communications managers on the
<a href="http://www.psnetwork.org.nz/resources-comms-function-review/" title="A Review of the Communications Function in NZ Govt">Review of the Function</a>,
or issuing the <acronym title="Request For Proposal">RFP</acronym> for the rebuild
of the SSC website with the stipulation that the solution had to be
open source so that we could reuse it across government.</p>

<p>You can probably see a theme emerging here. If you have read this blog at all, you will
definitely see where this is heading…</p>

<p>Anyway, I am about to start focussing on technology—and open source technology in
particular—on a full time basis. From the middle of this month, I join the team at
<a href="http://catalyst.net.nz/" title="Catalyst homepage">Catalyst</a>, New Zealand's leading
open source company, where I will be the newly minted Strategy and Relations Manager.</p>

<p>I'm thrilled to be able to work for a company that is dedicated to driving the uptake
of open source by businesses and government. Both the

and <a href="http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/business-of-it/2012/03/22/iceland-swaps-windows-for-linux-in-open-source-push-40154870/" title="Iceland dumps windows for Linux in the public sector">public sectors</a>
around the world are really starting to grasp the strategic and economic benefits of using
open source; we are going to be doing our best to accelerate that adoption.</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>

<li>I have used the term proudly for the last eight years, and will continue to do so…</li>
<li>Yes, my <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonwryan">twitter stream</a> will likely become a little more colourful.</li>
