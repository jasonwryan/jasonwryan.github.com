<p>I have been experimenting with a couple of new window managers over the
last week or so. Not that I am in any way dissatisfied with
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/" title="suckless page for dwm">dwm</a> — far from it; I
do from time to time, however, like to see what else is on offer.</p>

<p><a href="http://wmfs.info/projects/wmfs" title="WMFS homepage">WMFS</a> is a fairly new
entrant in the window manager marketplace. The developers describe it
as:</p>

<blockquote><p>a lightweight and highly configurable tiling window manager for X… It
supports Xft (Freetype) fonts and is compliant with the Extended
Window Manager Hints (EWMH) specifications, Xinerama and Xrandr.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=26924" title="AUR page">git version is available</a> in
AUR, and is straightforward to build and install. The fun, as always,
comes with customization…</p>

<p>As is says on the box, WMFS is highly configurable. The configuration is
all done (initially) in one file, which you will need to copy to your
<span class="file">~/.config/wmfs/directory</span>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>cp /etc/xdg/wmfs/wmfsrc ~/.config/wmfs/
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Even the default config is relatively fully featured. There are nine
default layouts (about five more than I usually need, but it is always
better to over cater). The <span class="file">wmfsrc</span> is quite well
commented, so most of the options are self explanatory.</p>

<p>One thing I did note about editing this file, which is probably more a
reflection of my haste rather than the wm itself, is that it seemed
<em>very</em> unforgiving of any errors. More than once I had to copy the
default wmfsrc back across and start again. My advice is to make any
changes cumulatively, and test by reloading before continuing.</p>

<p>You can see my config file in my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/36ae3d14507b/.config/wmfs/wmfsrc" title="Mercurial repository for EeePC">bitbucket repo</a>.
Most of the changes have been made in setting up my preferred tags and
keybindings – so they are consistent with my dwm and
<a href="http://plhk.ru/" title="Echinus window manager home">echinus</a> setups.</p>

<p>One of the great features of WMFS is the status bar. You can pipe all
sorts of information into it with a bash script, and you can use colours
and icons (if that is your thing). Simply sourcing the bash script from
within wmfsrc will see it up and running:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">background_command</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$HOME/.config/wmfs/autostart.sh&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Or, if you prefer to use conky:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>conky | <span class="k">while </span><span class="nb">read</span> -r; <span class="k">do </span>wmfs -s -name <span class="s2">&quot;$REPLY&quot;</span>; <span class="k">done</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>I use the status bar to display some basic system information. You can
see from
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/36ae3d14507b/Scripts/wmfs-status" title="Script in bitbucket repo">my status script</a>
that most of it is simply piping commands through the awesomeness that
is <a href="http://awk.info/" title="Awk Community Portal">awk</a>.</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought that I would find a replacement for dwm, but WMFS is a
serious contender. It has all of the functionality out-of-the-box,
including:</p>

<ul>
<li>pre-set layout per tag</li>
<li>rules to send applications to specific tags</li>
<li>completely customizable keybinds, and – as a bonus,</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi" title="Wikipedia page">Vi</a>-driven
command interface</li>
</ul>


<p>Unlike dwm, it requires no patching for any of this. It has been
completely stable while I have been using it and, while not as light as
dwm, it is still in the minimalist camp in terms of size.</p>
