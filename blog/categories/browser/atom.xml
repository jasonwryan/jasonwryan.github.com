I have written about <a href="http://vimprobable.org" title="Vimprobable homepage">Vimprobable</a>
a couple of times over the last two years<sup>1</sup>,
it is one of those projects that, for a variety of reasons, I have picked up
and stuck with.  Like <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org" title="dwm homepage">dwm</a>,
<a href="http://vim.org" title="Vim homepage">Vim</a> and
<a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/" title="tmux homepage">tmux</a>,
it is an essential part of my working environment and is installed on all of my
machines, where it is my default browser. It's simplicity, power and
configurability are why, despite looking at a few other similar projects, I
have stuck with Vimprobable since first installing it.</p>

<p>After my last post, a <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/09/28/screencast/" title="An intro to dwm">dwm screencast</a>,
I wanted to have another crack at making a decent screencast. Sadly,
this is not it.  I can say that making a <em>good</em> screencast is not a simple
accomplishment; there are so many elements that require significant attention. I
spent a good many hours this time around playing with custom Xorg modelines,
<code>ffmpeg</code>'s arcane encoding options and, to be frank, the final product is just not worth
all that effort.</p>

<p>I'm going to stick with plain text from now on. It requires little more from me
than a passing acquaintance with the subject matter, some loosely held and
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/08/18/trolls/" title="Trolling Arch Linux">firmly expressed opinions</a>
and my unbridled confidence in the fact that anyone who
has read this far down the page is so bereft of other, more pressing things to
think about that they may inadvertently find a scintilla of amusement in here…</p>

<p>With that explanation out of the way, I give you my final screencast:</p>

    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2011/06/26/using-vimprobable</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/vimprobable2.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/10/07/vimprobable/" title="Post on using Vimprobable">posted last year about Vimprobable</a>
a <a href="http://www.webkit.org/" title="Webkit site">webkit browser</a> that uses
Vim-like keybinds and can be run completely without the rodent.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of months I have become increasingly comfortable
with it, and with the addition of
<a href="http://vimprobable.org/pipermail/vimprobable-users/2011-June/000800.html" title="External handlers patch on ML">some great recent functionality</a>,
it has become my default browser.</p>

<p>The project has good documentation, in the form of two man pages:
<code>vimprobable</code> and <code>vimprobablerc</code>, but I thought I’d share some of my
customizations and working methods.</p>

<h3>Copy &amp; Paste</h3>

<p>The only time I have been tempted to take my hand off the keyboard was
to insert the cursor at the correct character to begin a selection to
copy and paste. This is unnecessary. With the right options in
<span class="file">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vimprobable/vimprobablerc</span>,
you can do it all from the keyboard.</p>

<p>Map the keys you would like to use to enter and exit caret mode. I use
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>c</kbd> to enter and <kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>c</kbd> to
return to normal mode:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>map &lt;C-c&gt;<span class="o">=</span>:set <span class="nv">caret</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">true</span>
</span><span class='line'>map &lt;S-c&gt;<span class="o">=</span>:set <span class="nv">caret</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">false</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Then, it is just a matter of identifying the text that you wish to copy
(in the photo above I was copying a script to launch <code>tabbed</code>), and
highlighting it via search. So the sequence is:</p>

<pre>
1.  <kbd>/</kbd> - to enter search mode
2.  <kbd>#</kbd><kbd>!</kbd> <kbd>Enter</kbd> - the shebang and then enter to highlight the correct
    sequence
3.  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>c</kbd> to enter caret mode
4.  and then <kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>Up</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>Down</kbd> to highlight the following or
    preceding lines
5.  yanking the selected text is <kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>y</kbd>, and the text is now stored in
    your clipboard.
</pre>


<h3>Opening new instances in tabbed</h3>

<p>I highlighted the section on tabbed from the
<a href="http://www.vimprobable.org/" title="Vimprobable website">Vimprobable site</a> for a reason.
The second tip is how to set up
<a href="http://tools.suckless.org/tabbed" title="tabbed on suckless.org">tabbed</a> to
work well with other applications.</p>

<p>By default, any new windows (ie., instances of Vimprobable) opened from
within Vimprobable are “caught”—and managed— by <code>tabbed</code>. However, if you
open a link from, say
<a href="http://newsbeuter.org/" title="ncurses rss reader">newsbeuter</a> or
<a href="http://tyrs.nicosphere.net/index.html" title="ncurses twitter/identi.ca client">Tyrs</a>,
this will open an instance outside <code>tabbed</code> which, if you are using a
tiling window manager like
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/" title="THE titling wm">dwm</a>, means this window gets
pushed to master in your stack. This is not entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p>Thanks to
<a href="http://lists.suckless.org/dev/1106/8761.html" title="Tabbed thread on suckless ML">Connor Lane Smith on the suckless ML</a>,
I have a solution to have all new instances of Vimprobable sent to
<code>tabbed</code>, whether opened in another application, or if I click on a link
in my terminal, <a href="http://www.rxvt.org/" title="Rxvt. org">Urxvtc</a>.</p>

<p>CLS’s solution is elegantly simple. Launch tabbed with an <code>.xid</code> file in
<psan class="file">/tmp</span>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="s2">&quot;$(tabbed -d &gt;/tmp/tabbed.xid); vimprobable2 -e $(&amp;lt;/tmp/tabbed.xid)&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Then it is just a matter of setting up other applications to pass links
to the <code>tabbed</code> <span class="file">tmp</span> file. For example, in my
<span class="file">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tyrs/tyrs.cfg</span>, I have:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">openurl_command</span> <span class="o">=</span> vimprobable2 -e <span class="k">$(</span>&amp;lt;/tmp/tabbed.xid<span class="k">)</span> %s
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The workaround for Urxvtc was a little trickier. I finally got there
with some help from
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/15550/passing-clicked-links-in-rxvt-to-a-script/15555#15555" title="Unix SE answer">Riccardo Murri on Unix &amp; Linux SE</a>.
In my <span class="file">~/.Xdefaults</span> I have:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>! -- Clickable urls -- !
</span><span class='line'>URxvt.perl-ext-common: default,matcher
</span><span class='line'>URxvt.urlLauncher: /home/jason/Scripts/vimprobtab.sh
</span><span class='line'>URxvt.matcher.button: 1
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>…and the wrapper script <span class="file">vimprobtab.sh</span> looks like this:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1&gt;!/bin/bash&lt;/h1&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1&gt;Script to open Vimprobable instances in tabbed&lt;/h1&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;exec vimprobable2 -e <span class="k">$(</span>&amp;lt;/tmp/tabbed.xid<span class="k">)</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$1&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Now whenever I open a link in an application or by clicking a link in
the terminal (in <a href="http://irssi.org/" title="IRC client">irssi</a>, for example)
it is passed to Vimprobable in <code>tabbed</code>.</p>

    <link href="http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2011/05/05/w3m/"/>
    <updated>2011-05-05T19:57:00+12:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2011/05/05/w3m</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/w3m.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I posted a couple of weeks ago about
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2011/04/13/archwiki-elvis-for-surfraw/" title="My post on the Arch Wiki elvis">how much I was enjoying Surfraw</a>,
to the point of writing a couple of my own <em>elvi</em>. As part of the
ongoing tweaking of my Surfraw experience, I have been experimenting
with different
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_web_browser" title="Wikipedia entry: text browsers">text-based browsers</a>,
to see which one best fits my workflow.</p>

<p>I have previously been using both
<a href="http://www.jikos.cz/~mikulas/links/" title="Links homepage (Spartan enough for you?)">links</a>
and it’s homonym,
<a href="http://lynx.browser.org/" title="See you, and raise you...">lynx</a>. While
these have been perfectly acceptable, they weren’t quite providing the
level of functionality —and integration with my vim-oriented workflow—
that I was looking for. Enter
<a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/" title="Lavish, by comparison...">w3m</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>w3m is a text-based web browser as well as a pager like `more’ or
`less’. With w3m you can browse web pages through a terminal emulator
window (xterm, rxvt or something like that). Moreover, w3m can be used
as a text formatting tool which typesets HTML into plain text.</p></blockquote>

<p>w3m is a step up from the other two for a variety of reasons. It
supports tables, frames, SSL connections, color and inline images. It
also renders pages in a form as true to their original layout as
possible. The killer features on top of that are, for me, the above
mentioned rendering of HTML as text (meaning you can save content
easily), and the customizable keybinds.</p>

<p>There was however, one significant sticking point. After countless hours
fruitlessly searching, I was unable to find a way to yank URLs to the
clipboard. As I have been spending a little time of late on
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/" title="Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange">Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</a>,
I thought I would ask the good folk there…</p>

<p>Less than fourty hours later, I had an answer so simple and elegant,
that I was literally grinning when I read it. It deserves quoting in
full. It is that ingenious.</p>

<blockquote><p>Set the “External Browser” option to
<code>sh -c 'echo "$0" | xsel'</code></p>

<p>You can use xsel -b to use the clipboard instead of the primary
selection. An alternative to
<a href="http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/" title="xsel homepage">xsel</a>
is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/" title="xclip homepage">xclip</a>
(xclip for the primary selection, xclip -selection CLIPBOARD for the
clipboard).</p>

<p>In <span class="file">~/.w3m/config</span>, that’s the extbrowser setting.
Then press M to copy (yank) the URL of the current page, or ESCM to
copy the URL of the link under the cursor.</p>

<p>You can use the second or third external browser for that instead;
then the key combination is 2M or 3M or 2ESCM or 3ESCM.
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12497/yanking-urls-in-w3m/12572#12572" title="THE answer">Gilles on Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This simple hack means that it is now trivial to yank either the URL of
the current page, or of the link under the cursor to primary selection.
It was just a matter then of adding some intuitive keybinds – as the <kbd>M</kbd>
and <kbd>Escape</kbd><kbd>M</kbd> combination are redolent of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war" title="Emacs vs Vi">the unamed editor</a>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'><span class="nb">keymap</span> <span class="k">y</span> EXTERN    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">br</span>/<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">keymap</span> Y EXTERN_LINK
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The perfect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" title="The UNIX philosophy on Wikipedia">UNIX solution</a>…</p>

<h4>Updated 8/5/11</h4>

<p>Gilles has edited and updated his answer with a slight change:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>sh -c <span class="s1">&#39;printf %s &quot;$0&quot; | xsel&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>This prevents a new line being appended.</p>

    <link href="http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2010/10/07/vimprobable/"/>
    <updated>2010-10-07T16:23:00+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2010/10/07/vimprobable</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonwryan/5055695051/" title="Vimprobable on Flickr"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/vimprobable.png" title="Hacked Vimprobable2" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>After just posting details of <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/10/04/the-setup/">my setup</a>,
I have made a reasonably significant (and it goes almost without saying, unplanned)
change: after <a href="http://www.uzbl.org/">uzbl</a> began unaccountably maxxing
out my CPU, I decided to give <a href="http://www.vimprobable.org/">Vimprobable</a>
a go.</p>

<p>I covered it briefly in my review of <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/05/21/5-alternate-browsers/">5 alternate browsers</a> and liked the
idea of another vim-based browsing experience.</p>

<p>There are two versions of Vimprobable; the differences, as described on
the website:</p>

<blockquote><p>Both versions are actively maintained. The first version can only be
customised by editing config.h before compiling. It is pretty stable
and very usable. Version 2 has grown fairly stable already as well,
but it’s still seeing bigger changes, of course. It aims at allowing
more customisation, for example through :set and :map commands.</p></blockquote>

<p>I downloaded the tarball for
<a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=33779" title="Arch User Repository: Vimprobable2">Vimprobable2 from the AUR</a>,
extracted the files and built the package.</p>

<p>Customization occurs in 3 files<sup>1</sup>: the first two,
<span class="file">config.h</span> and <span class="file">keymap.h</span>
both require you to recompile after editing, which is a trivial task
given the size of the programme.</p>

<p>Vimprobable2 also features a third configuration option that doesn’t
require compiling after changes, <span class="file">vimprobablerc</span>.
Should you wish to use it, you will need to create this file in
<span class="file">~/.config/vimprobable/</span>.
Helpfully, there is a man page for all of the options in this file, to
read it issue:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>man vimprobablerc
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Despite it’s spartan appearance, Vimprobable is a full-featured browser
— with the advantage of being driven solely from the keyboard. It
handles bookmarks (and the tagging thereof, which is impressive and
handy), multiple search engines, cookies, history, etc…</p>

<p>I have made a number of changes to the defaults, including moving some
of the keybindings to be closer to uzbl’s (habit, really). The other
area where I made some minor changes was to the hinting style. Hinting
is just the way Vimprobable (and other browsers like uzbl and
<a href="http://conkeror.org/">Conkeror</a>) follow links; the default is, to put
it mildly, garish<sup>2</sup>, so I hacked around in <span class="file">hinting.js</span>
to make it more attractive.</p>

<p>If you are interested, my vimprobable files are in
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/tip/Build/vimprobable2-git/">bitbucket</a>,
including the modified hinting.js.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>I think this is a keeper. I installed
<a href="http://tools.suckless.org/tabbed" title="suckless' tabbed">tabbed</a> and now
open Vimprobable in tabbed for tab management. A quick addition to my
keybinds in <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/" title="dynamic window manager">dwm</a> and
I have a minimalist and powerful browser…</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>

<ol>
<li><p>Of course, you are not limited to these files; the beauty of free
and open-source software is that you can change any of it…</p></li>
<li><p>To support this claim, I searched google for an image of the default
Vimprobable hinting style, and I could only find this
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/linuxjournal/articles/103/10387/10387f2.jpg">screenshot of conkeror</a>,
which will give you an idea…</p></li>

    <link href="http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2010/02/27/using-uzbl/"/>
    <updated>2010-02-27T10:19:00+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2010/02/27/using-uzbl</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonwryan/4352140405/" title="Arch &amp; uzbl by jasonwryan, on Flickr"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/uzbl.jpg" alt="Arch &amp;
uzbl" /></a></p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I switched my default browser from
<a href="http://conkeror.org/" title="Conkeror homepage">Conkeror</a> to
<a href="http://www.uzbl.org/" title="uzbl homepage">uzbl</a>. It wasn’t that I was
dissatisfied with Conkeror <em>per se</em>; more that as I was almost
exclusively using vim-like applications, it seemed almost perverse to be
browsing with an application that used Emacs-style keybindings. Over
time, the simplest operations seemed—in comparison to
<a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="THE $EDITOR">Vim</a>— to demand ridiculously complex
key strokes.</p>

<p>So, I installed uzbl.</p>

<blockquote><p>Uzbl follows the UNIX philosophy - “Write programs that do one thing
and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to
handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.”
<a href="http://www.uzbl.org/">uzbl homepage</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Consequently, the default uzbl version is designed to do little more
than browse web pages. It doesn’t handle cookies, manage downloads,
block ads, save bookmarks, or do any of the things that you would expect
of its WebKit kin, <del>Firefox</del> Safari and Chrome.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that it <em>can’t</em> do any of these things; like any
well-designed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX" title="Wikipedia entry">UNIX</a> program, it
is extensible and interoperable with programs through a range of
scripts. The difference is that you get to choose which functionality
matters to you, and implement it on an as-needs basis. This makes uzbl
very light, very fast, and very powerful.</p>

<p>The version I installed, uzbl-tabbed, ships with a number of default
scripts that perform most of the functions that you will need. There is
also a <a href="http://www.uzbl.org/wiki/scripts" title="uzbl wiki: scripts">scripts page</a>
on the wiki that has a growing number of scripts contributed by users.</p>

<p>I installed a couple of <a href="http://pbrisbin.com:8080/pages/scripts.html" title="Pat's scripts page">Pat Brisbin’s scripts</a>;
an ingenious bash script for bookmarking that creates an HTML page of
your bookmarks that you can serve locally or remotely (I keep mine on
<a href="http://www.dropbox.com" title="Dropbox home">Dropbox</a> so I can access it from
my phone as well), and a tidy little download manager.</p>

<p>Like Vim, uzbl is modal; you switch between command and insert mode. By
configuring uzbl to use Vim key bindings, you can seamless integrate it
into your desktop environment. Here you can see the status bar showing
uzbl in command mode, on the Arch forums home page, which has completely
loaded (the other figure is the X root window number).</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/uzbl-bar.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>As an Arch Linux user, I’m keen to support a project that has been
developed by the Arch community (if you want to see the history of the
project, there is a <a href="http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=70700&amp;p=1" title="uzbl history">long thread</a>
on the Arch boards); but ultimately this software appeals because it is
so configurable: you can customize it to your heart’s content (see my
config file on my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/tip/uzbl/" title="uzbl file on bitbucket">mercurial repo</a>).</p>

<p>There are packages for most of the major distros: <a href="http://www.uzbl.org/get.php" title="Download and install details on the wiki">give it a go</a>.</p>
