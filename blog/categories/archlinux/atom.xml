    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/arch-elvis.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I have been using
<a href="http://surfraw.alioth.debian.org/" title="Surfraw manifesto">Surfraw</a> for the
better part of eighteen months, and I think that it is a perfect Unix
tool: it does <em>one</em> thing, extremely well… If you haven’t come across
it, Surfraw is a command-line interface to a couple of dozen
repositories of knowledge. It is described thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>It reclaims google, altavista, babelfish, dejanews, freshmeat,
research index, slashdot and many others from the false-prophet,
pox-infested heathen lands of html-forms, placing these wonders where
they belong, deep in unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the
shell.<sup>1</sup></p></blockquote>

<p>The shell scripts that power the searches of the repositories are called
<em>elvi</em>, the singular being <em>elvis</em>. Currently, in
<a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=surfraw/surfraw.git;a=summary" title="Debian Git Repo: Surfraw">the git repo</a>,
there are
<a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=surfraw/surfraw.git;a=tree;f=elvi;hb=HEAD" title="elvi in the git repo">over 100 elvi</a>,
ranging from Wikipedia through to the CIA website (yes, the project was
founded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange" title="Julian's Wikipedia page">Julian Assange</a>),
Slashdot and The Wayback Machine.</p>

<p>As comprehensive as the list of elvi is, there was one glaring hole.
Arch Linux is represented in terms of elvi to search the
<a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/" title="Arch User Repository">AUR</a> and the
<a href="http://www.archlinux.org/packages/" title="Arch Package Database">official package repositories</a>,
but nothing for the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_Page" title="Definitive Arch Linux documentation">Arch Wiki</a>,
perhaps the best GNU/Linux reference wiki on the web.</p>

<p>So I thought I would rectify that.</p>

<p>You can grab the archwiki elvis from my
<a href="http://beta.intuxication.org/jasonwryan/longbow/file/tip/scripts/archwiki" title="Intuxication repo">mercurial repo</a>,
copy it into your local directory at <span class="file">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/surfraw/elvi/</span> or
in the system folder at <span class="file">$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/surfraw/</span> and you can surf the
Arch Wiki, or any one of the nine other language wikis, from the command
line.</p>

<blockquote><p>Surfrawize the soul of your favourite internet wonder. Join the
<strong>S</strong>hell <strong>U</strong>sers’ <strong>R</strong>evolutionary <strong>F</strong>ront <strong>A</strong>gainst the
WW<strong>W</strong> by submitting code. Reclaim heathen lands. Bear witness to the
truth. Its love will set you free.</p></blockquote>

    <link href="http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2011/01/25/setting-urgent-hints-in-dwm/"/>
    <updated>2011-01-25T17:45:00+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2011/01/25/setting-urgent-hints-in-dwm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonwryan/5379701719/#/photos/jasonwryan/5379701719/lightbox/" title="Arch Linux: dwm with statuscolors patch"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/dwm-urgent.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>After nearly 12 months of running a pretty stable
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org" title="dwm homepage">dwm</a>, with a consistent
patchset (cycle,
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/push" title="Push on suckless wiki">push</a>,
and init pertag<sup>1</sup>) I finally added another one:
statuscolours<sup>2</sup>…</p>

<p>I have been experimenting with
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/2010-12-26-wmfs-window-manager-from-scratch" title="My post on using WMFS">WMFS</a>,
which is another very nice, minimal tiling window manager and was really
enjoying the urgency hints in the status bar, so I decided to patch that
functionality into dwm.</p>

<p>Most terminal applications will send a bell when your attention is
required; in my case, I was looking for a way to trigger notifications
for new mail in
<a href="http://www.mutt.org/" title="If you are using another mail user agent, you are doing it wrong...">mutt</a>
or highlights in <a href="http://irssi.org/" title="IRC client">irssi</a>. In mutt, it
was just a case of setting a bell for when mail arrived:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span>beep_new             <span class="c"># bell on new mail</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>And in irssi:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">beep_msg_level</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;NOTICE MSGS HILIGHT&quot;</span>;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>In <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/" title="terminal mulitplexer">tmux</a>, to cover
all your terminal bases, add:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">set</span> -g bell-action any <span class="c"># listen for activity on all windows</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The next step is to pass those beeps to your terminal. The entry for
Urxvt is one I picked up after a quick search turned up
<a href="http://rsontech.net/articles/2008/11/17/1/handling-urgency-hints" title="Post on reson.tech">this post by rson</a>
which had the .Xdefaults line I was looking for:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>URxvt*urgentOnBell: <span class="nb">true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Now, whenever a bell is triggered in irssi or mutt, that is passed to
the terminal as an urgent hint. The final step was patching statuscolors
into dwm.c to change the tag colour when the hint was received.</p>

<p>You can see my
<a href="http://beta.intuxication.org/jasonwryan/archer/file/tip/Build/dwm/5.8.2-2.diff" title="dwm.c patched">patched dwm.c</a>
in my intuxication repo.</p>

    <link href="http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2011/01/08/mail-checking-script/"/>
    <updated>2011-01-08T11:04:00+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2011/01/08/mail-checking-script</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/mailcheck.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.mutt.org/" title="Mutt homepage">mutt</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/wiki" title="Offlineimap on github">offlineimap</a>
to manage email on my Arch Linux machines. I like the simplicity and the
power that this approach offers; that’s power in the sense of
extensibility and customization, by the way…</p>

<p>Using <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/" title="dwm homepage">dwm</a> as my window
manager, I had relied on
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/2009-11-21-dzen2-and-conky-cli-in-dwm" title="My post on setting this up">conky and dzen2</a>
to pipe system information into my status bar. Unfortunately, conky only
supports one mail spool so if, like me, you use offlineimap to
synchronize multiple mailboxes, conky would only show new mail in your
primary box. I had asked in #conky about multiple mail spools, but it
doesn’t seem to be supported.</p>

<p>When I recently started using
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/2010-12-26-wmfs-window-manager-from-scratch" title="My post on Window Manager From Scratch">WMFS</a>
I decided to move to a
<a href="http://beta.intuxication.org/jasonwryan/archer/file/tip/Scripts/wmfs-status" title="Script in intuxication repo">bash script for my status information</a>.
So I approached the problem afresh and decided to write a script to poll
the new mail directories and update my status bar when mail arrived.</p>

<p>Offlineimap creates a directory structure like so:</p>

<pre><code>   Mail/ -------
      |         |
      |     Mail_Account_1
      |         |
      |         | --  INBOX 
      |         |       | -- cur
      |         |       | -- new
      |         |       | -- temp
      |         |
      |         | -- INBOX.Drafts
      |         |       | -- cur
</code></pre>

<p>As I was only interested in checking the <span class="file">INBOX/new</span>
directory of each account, I had imagined that it would be necessary to set up some
elaborate array to effectively check each of the requisite sub-directories…</p>

<p>No, it was pretty simple. Just
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/abs/HTML/globbingref.html" title="ABS entry on globing">globbing</a>
and
<a href="http://linuxmanpages.com/man1/find.1.php" title="man page for find">find</a>,
actually.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>mailcheck.sh </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1&gt;!/bin/bash&lt;/h1&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1&gt;Set maildirs&lt;/h1&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;maildirs<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;$HOME/Mail/*/INBOX/new/&quot;</span>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;find <span class="nv">$maildirs</span> -type f | wc -l
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">exit </span>0
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The glob (<code>*</code>) takes care of the different mail account names, and has
the added bonus of being portable, and find returns any files (<code>-type f</code>)
with <code>wc</code> counting the number of lines (the <code>-l</code> switch).</p>

    <link href="http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2010/12/26/wmfs-window-manager-from-scratch/"/>
    <updated>2010-12-26T11:08:00+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2010/12/26/wmfs-window-manager-from-scratch</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonwryan/5289976238/lightbox/" title="Screenshot on Flickr"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/wmfs.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>I have been experimenting with a couple of new window managers over the
last week or so. Not that I am in any way dissatisfied with
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/" title="suckless page for dwm">dwm</a> — far from it; I
do from time to time, however, like to see what else is on offer.</p>

<p><a href="http://wmfs.info/projects/wmfs" title="WMFS homepage">WMFS</a> is a fairly new
entrant in the window manager marketplace. The developers describe it
as:</p>

<blockquote><p>a lightweight and highly configurable tiling window manager for X… It
supports Xft (Freetype) fonts and is compliant with the Extended
Window Manager Hints (EWMH) specifications, Xinerama and Xrandr.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=26924" title="AUR page">git version is available</a> in
AUR, and is straightforward to build and install. The fun, as always,
comes with customization…</p>

<p>As is says on the box, WMFS is highly configurable. The configuration is
all done (initially) in one file, which you will need to copy to your
<span class="file">~/.config/wmfs/directory</span>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>cp /etc/xdg/wmfs/wmfsrc ~/.config/wmfs/
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Even the default config is relatively fully featured. There are nine
default layouts (about five more than I usually need, but it is always
better to over cater). The <span class="file">wmfsrc</span> is quite well
commented, so most of the options are self explanatory.</p>

<p>One thing I did note about editing this file, which is probably more a
reflection of my haste rather than the wm itself, is that it seemed
<em>very</em> unforgiving of any errors. More than once I had to copy the
default wmfsrc back across and start again. My advice is to make any
changes cumulatively, and test by reloading before continuing.</p>

<p>You can see my config file in my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/36ae3d14507b/.config/wmfs/wmfsrc" title="Mercurial repository for EeePC">bitbucket repo</a>.
Most of the changes have been made in setting up my preferred tags and
keybindings – so they are consistent with my dwm and
<a href="http://plhk.ru/" title="Echinus window manager home">echinus</a> setups.</p>

<p>One of the great features of WMFS is the status bar. You can pipe all
sorts of information into it with a bash script, and you can use colours
and icons (if that is your thing). Simply sourcing the bash script from
within wmfsrc will see it up and running:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">background_command</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$HOME/.config/wmfs/autostart.sh&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Or, if you prefer to use conky:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>conky | <span class="k">while </span><span class="nb">read</span> -r; <span class="k">do </span>wmfs -s -name <span class="s2">&quot;$REPLY&quot;</span>; <span class="k">done</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>I use the status bar to display some basic system information. You can
see from
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/36ae3d14507b/Scripts/wmfs-status" title="Script in bitbucket repo">my status script</a>
that most of it is simply piping commands through the awesomeness that
is <a href="http://awk.info/" title="Awk Community Portal">awk</a>.</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought that I would find a replacement for dwm, but WMFS is a
serious contender. It has all of the functionality out-of-the-box,
including:</p>

<ul>
<li>pre-set layout per tag</li>
<li>rules to send applications to specific tags</li>
<li>completely customizable keybinds, and – as a bonus,</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi" title="Wikipedia page">Vi</a>-driven
command interface</li>
</ul>


<p>Unlike dwm, it requires no patching for any of this. It has been
completely stable while I have been using it and, while not as light as
dwm, it is still in the minimalist camp in terms of size.</p>

    <link href="http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2010/10/07/vimprobable/"/>
    <updated>2010-10-07T16:23:00+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2010/10/07/vimprobable</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonwryan/5055695051/" title="Vimprobable on Flickr"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/vimprobable.png" title="Hacked Vimprobable2" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>After just posting details of <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/2010-10-04-the-setup">my setup</a>,
I have made a reasonably significant (and it goes almost without saying, unplanned)
change: after <a href="http://www.uzbl.org/">uzbl</a> began unaccountably maxxing
out my CPU, I decided to give <a href="http://www.vimprobable.org/">Vimprobable</a>
a go.</p>

<p>I covered it briefly in my review of <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/2010-5-21-5-alternate-browsers">5 alternate browsers</a> and liked the
idea of another vim-based browsing experience.</p>

<p>There are two versions of Vimprobable; the differences, as described on
the website:</p>

<blockquote><p>Both versions are actively maintained. The first version can only be
customised by editing config.h before compiling. It is pretty stable
and very usable. Version 2 has grown fairly stable already as well,
but it’s still seeing bigger changes, of course. It aims at allowing
more customisation, for example through :set and :map commands.</p></blockquote>

<p>I downloaded the tarball for
<a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=33779" title="Arch User Repository: Vimprobable2">Vimprobable2 from the AUR</a>,
extracted the files and built the package.</p>

<p>Customization occurs in 3 files<sup>1</sup>: the first two,
<span class="file">config.h</span> and <span class="file">keymap.h</span>
both require you to recompile after editing, which is a trivial task
given the size of the programme.</p>

<p>Vimprobable2 also features a third configuration option that doesn’t
require compiling after changes, <span class="file">vimprobablerc</span>.
Should you wish to use it, you will need to create this file in
<span class="file">~/.config/vimprobable/</span>.
Helpfully, there is a man page for all of the options in this file, to
read it issue:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>man vimprobablerc
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Despite it’s spartan appearance, Vimprobable is a full-featured browser
— with the advantage of being driven solely from the keyboard. It
handles bookmarks (and the tagging thereof, which is impressive and
handy), multiple search engines, cookies, history, etc…</p>

<p>I have made a number of changes to the defaults, including moving some
of the keybindings to be closer to uzbl’s (habit, really). The other
area where I made some minor changes was to the hinting style. Hinting
is just the way Vimprobable (and other browsers like uzbl and
<a href="http://conkeror.org/">Conkeror</a>) follow links; the default is, to put
it mildly, garish<sup>2</sup>, so I hacked around in <span class="file">hinting.js</span>
to make it more attractive.</p>

<p>If you are interested, my vimprobable files are in
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/tip/Build/vimprobable2-git/">bitbucket</a>,
including the modified hinting.js.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>I think this is a keeper. I installed
<a href="http://tools.suckless.org/tabbed" title="suckless' tabbed">tabbed</a> and now
open Vimprobable in tabbed for tab management. A quick addition to my
keybinds in <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/" title="dynamic window manager">dwm</a> and
I have a minimalist and powerful browser…</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>

<ol>
<li><p>Of course, you are not limited to these files; the beauty of free
and open-source software is that you can change any of it…</p></li>
<li><p>To support this claim, I searched google for an image of the default
Vimprobable hinting style, and I could only find this
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/linuxjournal/articles/103/10387/10387f2.jpg">screenshot of conkeror</a>,
which will give you an idea…</p></li>
