    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/grub.jpg" title="Image of grub on Flickr" >
With the announcement late last month that
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2012-06/msg00093.html" title="Grub ML announcement">Grub 2.00 has been released</a>
I thought that it was time to stop procrastinating and do something about moving away from
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-legacy.html" title="Gnu Page for Grub Legacy">Grub Legacy</a>,
which is no longer actively developed. Not that there is anything wrong with Grub Legacy's
functionality; it has always done whatever I asked of it (admittedly, not a lot) and done so
without complaint.</p>

<p>I have used Grub2 before, when I was running Ubuntu on my home desktop, and it is the bootloader
on my Debian Squeeze server. I can't, however, say that I have ever really understood—or
appreciated—its mutliple file, “need to reconfigure after making any changes” type of
complexity. So, I thought that I would give
<a href="http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php/The_Syslinux_Project" title="Syslinux Wiki">Syslinux</a>
a shot.</p>

<p>Syslinux isn't a single bootloader, rather it is a collection of lightweight bootloaders,
with <a href="http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php/EXTLINUX" title="Extlinux page on Syslinux Wiki">Extlinux</a>
responsible for booting ext2, ext3, ext4 and btrfs filesystems. As the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Syslinux" title="The FINE Wiki">Arch Wiki Syslinux page</a>
notes, since Syslinux 4, Extlinux has been merged with Syslinux.</p>

<p>Installing Syslinux is <em>ridiculously</em> easy. It is literally a five step process. First,
install the package:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pacman -S syslinux</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>After installing <code>syslinux</code> pacman will helpfully tell you what to do next:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>==> If you want to use syslinux as your bootloader<br/>==> edit /boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg and run<br/>==>   # /usr/sbin/syslinux-install_update -i -a -m<br/>==> to install it.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Arch user <a href="http://pyther.net/" title="Matthew's website">Matthew Gyurgyik</a> has written an
ingenious script, <code>syslinux-install_update</code> that automates the process of writing the
<acronym title="Master Boot Record">MBR</acronym> and installing the relevant files to
<span class="file">/boot/syslinux/</span>. The script also checks if, as is the case
with my desktop, there is a RAID array present, and if so passes the install command the
<code>--raid</code> flag:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>RAID mode.  If boot fails, tell the BIOS to boot the next device in the boot sequence (usually the next  hard<br/>disk) instead of stopping with an error message.  This is useful for RAID-1 booting.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>After running the script, you should receive a message advising you that Syslinux
has been sucessfully installed on both drives:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Detected RAID on /boot - installing Syslinux with --raid<br/>Syslinux install successful<br/>Boot Flag Set - /dev/sda1<br/>Boot Flag Set - /dev/sdb1<br/>Installed MBR (/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin) to /dev/sda<br/>Installed MBR (/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin) to /dev/sdb</p></blockquote></p>

<p>And that, in their entirety, is steps two and three.</p>

<p>If you are moving from Grub Legacy, configuring Syslinux is similarly painless.
There are two sections to a basic  <span class="file">/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg</span>,
the defaults and the prompt entries.</p>

<p>I set up my defaults to be essentially invisible:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># General settings
</span><span class='line'>DEFAULT Arch
</span><span class='line'>PROMPT 0
</span><span class='line'>TIMEOUT 0</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>And then copy across the relevant lines from my <span class="file">/boot/grub/menu.lst</span>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>grep <span class="nv">root</span><span class="o">=</span> /boot/grub/menu.lst &gt;&gt; /boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Then it is just a matter of adding the relevant entries under LABEL:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>LABEL Arch
</span><span class='line'>   MENU LABEL Arch Linux
</span><span class='line'>   LINUX ../vmlinuz-linux
</span><span class='line'>   APPEND root=/dev/mapper/vgroup-lvroot cryptdevice=/dev/md1:vgroup ro
</span><span class='line'>   INITRD ../initramfs-linux.img</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>You then add entries for Fallback, and any other images that you may wish to
boot from.</p>

<p>You then move to steps four and five:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pacman -Rsn grub
</span><span class='line'>shutdown -r now</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>And you reboot with Syslinux. Done.</p>

<p>The beauty of Syslinux, from my perspective, is that it is simple to install
and configure, with just the one config file and the options all well documented
and easy to understand. If you want a menu with a background
image, you can have that. If, like me, you just want to get on and boot your default,
it does that.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you want or need to boot into Fallback, or want to dual boot,
you can just hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd> at boot time and enter the desired
Label at the prompt. Syslinux has Tab completion, so you only need enter a
couple of letters, hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> and you will see all of the available
Labels to boot. Brilliant.</p>

    <link href="http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2012/06/16/misunderstanding/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-16T10:52:00+12:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2012/06/16/misunderstanding</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/hands.jpg" title="'mutt logo'" ></p>

<p>I am frequently struck by how many people arrive on the
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/" title="Arch Linux Forums">Arch boards</a> without <em>any</em>
understanding of how Arch is different from the other GNU/Linux communities
they may have spent time with (if, indeed, they have spent any time in
another community before trying Arch). For me, this is akin to arriving in a
foreign country and not bothering to familiarize yourself at all with the local
mores and customs; it lies on a spectrum somewhere between ignorance and
outright arrogance.</p>

<p>The result, inevitably, is that these people are shocked
when their expectations of how they <em>should</em> be treated are at odds with the
reception their behaviour invites…</p>

<p>Before venturing any further, I should preface my remarks about this with
something of a disclaimer. These are my own views and not those of the current,
or past, forum staff.</p>

<p>One of Arch's significant acheivements is the quality of
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org" title="THE best GNU/Linux Wiki">its documentation</a>.
Not just the technical documentation describing how to install and configure
Arch, but the cultural documentation that sets out
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way" title="The Arch Way">Arch's philosophy</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Forum_Etiquette" title="Forum Etiquette">standards of behaviour</a>. Both these pages provide clear statements on what to expect when
using Arch Linux and a clear indication of how to respectfully interact with the
community when you are seeking help.</p>

<p>The defining statement about Arch's intended user base is quite direct and
unambiguous:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Arch Linux targets and accommodates competent GNU/Linux users<br/>by giving them complete control and responsibility over the system.</p><footer><strong>The Arch Way</strong> <cite><a href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way#User-centric'>wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>The expression “targets and accommodates” doesn't exclude other users—for
example, those that are not necessarily competent, but are wanting to learn
more about the specifics of how their machines work—it does, however, signal
quite explicitly what sort of community Arch is. And what it is not.</p>

<p><a href="http://ubuntu.com" title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu</a> is an excellent distribution. Like Arch,
it has very specific aims and a clear concept of what the Ubuntu community is.
Popularity is central to Ubuntu's culture. People coming from Ubuntu, who
haven't bothered to familiarize themselves with Arch's values, often struggle
to appreciate the difference; leading to comments like this one:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Maybe if Arch is friendly and Arch forum is friendly, it might go some<br/>place, who knows…</p><footer><strong>Linux Journal commenter</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/arch-way#comment-361974'>www.linuxjournal.com/content/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>This was posted in reply to a post on Arch in which the author noted how to
seek help with Arch Linux:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>You'll find far less hand-holding on the Arch Forums than some of the other<br/>distro's forums, and for good reason.  Arch has one of the most informative,<br/>user-friendly wiki's out there. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT ask a question in the<br/>forums or on IRC without searching the wiki and the forums first.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Similarly, looking through the threads in
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewforum.php?id=23" title="Newbie board">Newbie Corner</a>
will periodically turn up new posters who are indignant at being told to
<acronym title="Read The Fscking Manual">RTFM</acronym> and see it as some
sort of <em>personal</em> attack, when in fact it is just someone pointing out the
obvious to them. The community hasn't compiled all that documentation just
so they can sit around and regurgitate answers for people who are either
unwilling or incapable of making the minimum amount of  effort required to
solve their own problems…</p>

<p>If you want handholding, there are plenty of online communities that will
cater for you. If you install Arch and think that you are automatically entitled
to immediate support for issues that you encounter, then you are mistaken.
If you think that Arch will suffer if you don't get what you want, then
your problems extend significantly beyond your choice of distro.</p>

<p>The community has worked hard over the years to keep the signal-to-noise ratio
on the boards high, that way, the forums remain a helpful resource for the community,
not a breeding ground for
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/03/17/vampires/" title="Post on parasites…">help vampires</a>.</p>

    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2012/05/23/notmuch</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/magnifier.png" title="day 307 on Flickr" >
Seeing as I have been focussing on my mail client, I thought I would round out the trifecta of
<a href="http://www.mutt.org/" title="mutt homepage">mutt</a> posts<sup>1</sup> with what I am assuming is the
final piece of the puzzle: searching <code>mutt's</code> maildirs. For a small to average size mailbox, <code>mutt's</code>
searching works fine, but as your mail volume grows this simple search doesn't really scale. That's
where the rather modestly named <a href="http://notmuchmail.org/" title="Notmuch website">Notmuch</a> comes into play.</p>

<p>It can be run as a standalone mail client, but you can also use it with <code>mutt</code> to provide
a ruthlessly efficient and fast search tool for your email. I had looked at it and
<a href="http://sup.rubyforge.org/" title="A console client for people with lots of mail">Sup</a>
a couple of years ago, but was spurred to do something about it this week when
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/chosig" title="Chosig on Twitter">Gunnar Lundström</a> pinged me on twitter and
suggested I check it out. So I did.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>"Not much mail" is what Notmuch thinks about your email collection. Even if you receive 12000<br/>messages per month or have on the order of  millions of messages that you've been saving for decades.<br/>Regardless, Notmuch will be able to quickly search all of it. It's just plain not much mail.</p><footer><strong>Notmuch website</strong> <cite><a href='http://notmuchmail.org'>notmuchmail.org/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>There was previously a
<a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2011/01/how_to_use_Notmuch_with_Mutt/">mutt-notmuch script</a>
for integrating the two, but the functionality was included upstream at the start of this year
so it is quite straightforward to set it up. There is a
<a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=36289" title="Arch User Repository package">package in the AUR</a>
but it is intended as the full mail client, complete with, <em>shudder</em>, emacs support amongst
other things. I have stripped out the uneeded bindings and included the relevant <code>perl</code> libraries in a
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/centurion/src/6ff0f252961f/Build/notmuch/PKGBUILD" title="…in my bitbucket repo">modified PKGBUILD</a>
if you just want the basic search with <code>mutt</code>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you'll need to step through it manually.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>pacman -S perl perl-mailtools perl-mail-box perl-string-shellquote
</span><span class='line'>cowerd notmuch perl-term-readline-gnu
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>As you will see from the PKGBUILD, you will need to copy the <code>notmuch-mutt</code> script
into your <code>$PATH</code>: you'll find it in <span class="file">contrib/notmuch-mutt/</span>.</p>

<p>There is a simple interative setup, which you can complete before running the index the first time:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>notmuch setup
</span><span class='line'>notmuch new
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The final step is to copy across the <code>mutt</code> macros included with the script:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>cat src/notmuch-0.13/contrib/notmuch-mutt/notmuch-mutt.rc &gt;&gt; <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.mutt/muttrc
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Now, from within <code>mutt</code>, <kbd>F8</kbd>, <kbd>F9</kbd> and <kbd>F6</kbd> will respectively
search, create the relevant threads from search results, and tag mails with <code>notmuch</code>.</p>

<p>As I use <code>offlineimap</code> to retrieve my mail, I simply added <code>notmuch new</code> to the script that
runs as a <code>cron</code> job to synch my mail and <code>notmuch</code> reindexes all of my mail as soon as it arrives.</p>

<h3>Updated 27/5/12</h3>

<p>Two of the <code>mutt</code> macros that are shipped in <span class="file">contrib/notmuch-mutt/notmuch-mutt.rc</span>
do not work. I have written a patch to fix this and
<a href="http://notmuchmail.org/pipermail/notmuch/2012/011263.html" title="Patch on notmuch list">posted it to the ML</a>.</p>

    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2012/05/12/mutt</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/mutt-1.png" title="'mutt logo'" ></p>

<p>Following on from my <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/04/21/lbdb/" title="Using mutt, LDAP and SSL">last post about mutt</a>,
I have been tinkering more with the most suckless of mail clients to
get it to deal with—of all things—<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>
emails. I will preface this post with a remark or two that amounts to a warning about
intemperate language, ranting and a generally cranky disposition: repeated contact with
email marketers can do that to you…</p>

<p>A further  brief digression is warranted here. HTML email is, without doubt,
evidence of the imminent end of civilized life as we know it; much like the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Places_in_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Golgafrincham" title="Wikipedia entry on HHGTTG">Golgafrincham diaspora</a>, it is attributable to a depraved cabal of marketing consultants
and provides the same level of social good as syphilis and fistulas. Suffice to say, it is a blight.</p>

<p>Sadly, it is a blight that I have to deal with. Up until now, I had done that by using the
excellent <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/" title="w3m homepage on sourceforge">w3m</a> to render
HTML as text in mutt itself. That is accomplished easily enough with an entry in
<span class="file">muttrc</span> and another in a <span class="file">mailcap</span> file.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>~/.mutt/muttrc </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>auto_view text/html                                      <span class="c"># view html automatically</span>
</span><span class='line'>alternative_order text/plain text/enriched text/html     <span class="c"># save html for last</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>~/.mutt/mailcap </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>text/html; w3m -I %<span class="o">{</span>charset<span class="o">}</span> -T text/html; copiousoutput;
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>This works for 80 percent of the HTML email I get. It is enough to confirm that the mail is useless
and can be discarded. The other 20 percent, however, is slightly more problematic. The initial
view in w3m is enough to tell me that, due to the outstanding incompetence of the idiots that
generated the email, there <em>is</em> actually some information that is contained in the email that I need
to access <strong>but it is not viewable in a text browser.</strong></p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/mutt-2.png" title="'An example…'" ></p>

<p>For this special level of retardation, I need to be able to open the email in a ghraphical browser.
As I use vimprobable, that means sending the file to
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2011/06/26/using-vimprobable/" title="My post on Using vimprobable">vimprobable running in tabbed</a>. Fortunately, as you would expect with superior software,
<code>mutt</code> has a way of handling this gracefully. In mutt's extensive documentation, there is a
<a href="http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-5.html" title="Go and read it…">page on mutt's MIME support</a>
that details how to set up a graduated response to this pernicious issue:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>In addition, you can use this with Autoview to denote two commands for viewing<br/>an attachment, one to be viewed automatically, the other to be viewed<br/>interactively from the attachment menu.</p><footer><strong>mutt manual</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-5.html'>www.mutt.org/doc/manual/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>So, you can have <code>mutt</code> render the HTML abomination in <code>w3m</code> in most cases, and when those
instances of particularly cretinous behaviour make it to your inbox, you can choose to
view them in your web browser. In my case, by altering the <span class="file">mailcap</span>
entry to look like this:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>text/html; vimprobtab.sh %s &amp;; <span class="nb">test</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">test</span> -n <span class="s2">&quot;$DISPLAY&quot;</span>; needsterminal;
</span><span class='line'>text/html; w3m -I %<span class="o">{</span>charset<span class="o">}</span> -T text/html; copiousoutput;
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The first entry tests that X is running, and if it is, it hands the file to <code>vimprobable</code>. The
default, however, is determined by the <code>copiousoutput</code> tag. So, in <code>mutt</code> it is just a matter
of hitting <kbd>v</kbd> to view the attached HTML and then <kbd>m</kbd> to send it to <code>mailcap</code>.
For convenience, I bind <kbd>Enter</kbd> to that function in <span class="file">muttrc</span>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">bind </span>attach &lt;<span class="k">return</span>&gt;    view-mailcap
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>One of the great things about starting a new job at
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/04/05/catalyst/" title="My post on joining Catalyst IT">an open source company</a>
is having the freedom to use the tools that suit your workflow, rather than
having to suffer the indignity of whatever the IT department consider to be the
lowest comon denominator. Suffice to say, I have had a lot of fun this week
setting up my working environment—and the ocassional hiccough as I was forced to learn
something new…</p>

<p>One of those “learning opportunities” consisted of trying to get my mail client,
<a href="http://www.mutt.org/" title="All mail clients suck. This one just sucks less.">mutt</a>
to talk to the <acronym title="Lightweight Directory Acces Protocol">LDAP</acronym>
directory over <acronym title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</acronym> so that I could
query the shared address book. There are a number of helpful blog posts that describe
using <a href="http://www.spinnaker.de/lbdb/" title="The Little Brother Database homepage">lbdb</a>
with <code>mutt</code><sup>1</sup>. Unfortunately, after a lot of searching, I was unable to find
any documentation on achieving this integration over a secure connection.
I kept seeing this error:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>Error: Search failed. LDAP server returned an error : 13, description: TLS
</span><span class='line'>confidentiality required at /usr/lib/mutt_ldap_query line 198, &lt;DATA&gt; line 558.
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Several hours later, and with some
help from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ibeardslee" title="Ian on Twitter: follow him…">@ibeardslee</a>,
I managed to set it up, and it was definitely worth the effort.</p>

<p>You will need to install <code>lbdb</code> from
<a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=10225" title="AUR package">the AUR</a>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>cowerd lbdb     <span class="c"># 2</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>…and a couple of packages from the repos to make it all work:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>pacman -S perl-ldap perl-io-socket-ssl netkit-bsd-finger
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Then it is a matter of configuring <code>lbdb</code> to both
query the LDAP directory and be able to be called from <code>mutt</code>.
First, copy the config files into your <span class="file">$HOME</span>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>mkdir .lbdb
</span><span class='line'>cp /etc/lbdb.rc .lbdb/lbdbrc
</span><span class='line'>cp /etc/lbdb_ldap.rc .lbdb/ldap.rc
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>And then modify the two configuration files to suit your setup:
The first, <span class="file">$HOME/.lbdb/lbdbrc</span>, is well commented and
self-explanatory; add <code>ldap</code> to the methods and the
nickname of your server:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">METHODS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;m_abook m_ldap&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">LDAP_NICKS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;catalyst&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The second config file, <span class="file">$HOME/.lbdb/ldap.rc</span>
is written in Perl and is a bit of a shocker:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='perl'><span class='line'><span class="nv">%ldap_server_db</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;</span><span class="s">&#39;catalyst&#39;</span> <span class="o">=&amp;</span><span class="ow">gt</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;ldaps://ldap.catalyst.net.nz:636&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="sr">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;h1&gt;</span><span class="n">hostname</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">your</span> <span class="n">ldap</span> <span class="n">server</span><span class="sr">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="nv">$ldap_server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;ldaps://ldap.catalyst.net.nz:636&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ldap_result_realname</span>  <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;${givenname} ${sn}&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ldap_bind_password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The key is to ensure that you use both the <code>ldaps</code>
prefix <strong>and</strong> explicitely specify the SSL port, 636. Without both of these, you will
get the TLS confidentiality error.</p>

<p>You can then test that it is working correctly by running a query:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>lbdbq jemima
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>All going well, if there is indeed a Jemima in the shared address book, you will see her
contact details miraculously appear before you. If there is more than one, you will have a
list to choose from.</p>

<p>Finally, you just need to set up <code>mutt</code> to query <code>lbdb</code>.
In your <span class="file">muttrc</span>, add the following:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">query_command</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;lbdbq %s 2&gt;/dev/null&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>I found that suppressing the errors made the whole experience a little smoother. You
may not require it… Now, hitting <kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>q</kbd> in <code>mutt</code>
brings up a prompt to query the LDAP directory (and my <a href="http://abook.sourceforge.net/" title="abook homepage">abook</a> address book that I share via
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" title="Dropbox homepage">dropbox</a>). You can also access the directory
by starting to type an email address and then hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>t</kbd> to see
a list of possible completions.</p>
