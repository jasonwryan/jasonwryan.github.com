    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonwryan/5055695051/" title="Vimprobable on Flickr"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/vimprobable.png" title="Hacked Vimprobable2" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>After just posting details of <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/post/1240576133/setup">my setup</a>,
I have made a reasonably significant (and it goes almost without saying, unplanned)
change: after <a href="http://www.uzbl.org/">uzbl</a> began unaccountably maxxing
out my CPU, I decided to give <a href="http://www.vimprobable.org/">Vimprobable</a>
a go.</p>

<p>I covered it briefly in my review of <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/post/618038288/browsers">5 alternate browsers</a> and liked the
idea of another vim-based browsing experience.</p>

<p>There are two versions of Vimprobable; the differences, as described on
the website:</p>

<blockquote><p>Both versions are actively maintained. The first version can only be
customised by editing config.h before compiling. It is pretty stable
and very usable. Version 2 has grown fairly stable already as well,
but it’s still seeing bigger changes, of course. It aims at allowing
more customisation, for example through :set and :map commands.</p></blockquote>

<p>I downloaded the tarball for
<a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=33779" title="Arch User Repository: Vimprobable2">Vimprobable2 from the AUR</a>,
extracted the files and built the package.</p>

<p>Customization occurs in 3 files<sup>1</sup>: the first two,
<span class="file">config.h</span> and <span class="file">keymap.h</span>
both require you to recompile after editing, which is a trivial task
given the size of the programme.</p>

<p>Vimprobable2 also features a third configuration option that doesn’t
require compiling after changes, <span class="file">vimprobablerc</span>.
Should you wish to use it, you will need to create this file in
<span class="file">~/.config/vimprobable/</span>.
Helpfully, there is a man page for all of the options in this file, to
read it issue:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>man vimprobablerc
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Despite it’s spartan appearance, Vimprobable is a full-featured browser
— with the advantage of being driven solely from the keyboard. It
handles bookmarks (and the tagging thereof, which is impressive and
handy), multiple search engines, cookies, history, etc…</p>

<p>I have made a number of changes to the defaults, including moving some
of the keybindings to be closer to uzbl’s (habit, really). The other
area where I made some minor changes was to the hinting style. Hinting
is just the way Vimprobable (and other browsers like uzbl and
<a href="http://conkeror.org/">Conkeror</a>) follow links; the default is, to put
it mildly, garish<sup>2</sup>, so I hacked around in <span class="file">hinting.js</span>
to make it more attractive.</p>

<p>If you are interested, my vimprobable files are in
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/tip/Build/vimprobable2-git/">bitbucket</a>,
including the modified hinting.js.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>I think this is a keeper. I installed
<a href="http://tools.suckless.org/tabbed" title="suckless' tabbed">tabbed</a> and now
open Vimprobable in tabbed for tab management. A quick addition to my
keybinds in <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/" title="dynamic window manager">dwm</a> and
I have a minimalist and powerful browser…</p>

<div class="footnotes">
1. Of course, you are not limited to these files; the beauty of free
and open-source software is that you can change any of it…
<br />
2. To support this claim, I searched google for an image of the default
Vimprobable hinting style, and I could only find this 
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/linuxjournal/articles/103/10387/10387f2.jpg">screenshot of conkeror</a>,
which will give you an idea…
