<p>After recovering from
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2011/09/28/delicious/" title="My post on the delicious fiasco">the shock of the botched delicious relaunch</a>,
I have switched to
<a href="http://pinboard.in/u:jasonwryan/" title="My bookmarks on Pinboard">Pinboard</a>
for my bookmarking. Previously, I was just synching my bookmarks from
delicious, but now I have abandoned that trainwreck completely.</p>

<p>Two things made the transition painless. The first was the
<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/me.mitnworb.save.to.pinboard/" title="Save to Pinboard page">Pinboard Android app</a>
so I could access and manage bookmarks from my phone; the second was a
little trickier.</p>

<p>As I have previously mentioned, I use bookmarking not just to retrieve
my own saved pages, but as a search repository for material that other
people have decided is interesting or valuable enough to want to save.
And there is no better tool for this sort of searching than
<a href="http://surfraw.alioth.debian.org/" title="Surfraw - Shell Users' Revolutionary Front Rage Against the Web">Surfraw</a><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>I had written an elvis to search delicious bookmarks, so to complete the
transition to Pinboard, I needed to do the same. It was a little
trickier than I had anticipated, as some of the URLs (particularly when
searching across multiple tags) were reasonably complex given my modest
scripting skills. But
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/241da582a0fd/.config/surfraw/elvi/pin" title="Pinboard elvis in mercurial repo">I got there in the end…</a></p>

<p>Now searching for web pages that I or anyone else has saved to Pinboard
is as simple as typing:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>pin -t<span class="o">=</span>unix+linux+vim
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Which will return all saved pages that share those three tags. I can
also refine my search to a particular user with the <code>-u</code>{ser} switch, or
just browse recent or popular tags. Simple, but ruthlessly efficient…</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/w3m.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I posted a couple of weeks ago about
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2011/04/13/archwiki-elvis-for-surfraw/" title="My post on the Arch Wiki elvis">how much I was enjoying Surfraw</a>,
to the point of writing a couple of my own <em>elvi</em>. As part of the
ongoing tweaking of my Surfraw experience, I have been experimenting
with different
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_web_browser" title="Wikipedia entry: text browsers">text-based browsers</a>,
to see which one best fits my workflow.</p>

<p>I have previously been using both
<a href="http://www.jikos.cz/~mikulas/links/" title="Links homepage (Spartan enough for you?)">links</a>
and it’s homonym,
<a href="http://lynx.browser.org/" title="See you, and raise you...">lynx</a>. While
these have been perfectly acceptable, they weren’t quite providing the
level of functionality —and integration with my vim-oriented workflow—
that I was looking for. Enter
<a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/" title="Lavish, by comparison...">w3m</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>w3m is a text-based web browser as well as a pager like `more’ or
`less’. With w3m you can browse web pages through a terminal emulator
window (xterm, rxvt or something like that). Moreover, w3m can be used
as a text formatting tool which typesets HTML into plain text.</p></blockquote>

<p>w3m is a step up from the other two for a variety of reasons. It
supports tables, frames, SSL connections, color and inline images. It
also renders pages in a form as true to their original layout as
possible. The killer features on top of that are, for me, the above
mentioned rendering of HTML as text (meaning you can save content
easily), and the customizable keybinds.</p>

<p>There was however, one significant sticking point. After countless hours
fruitlessly searching, I was unable to find a way to yank URLs to the
clipboard. As I have been spending a little time of late on
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/" title="Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange">Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</a>,
I thought I would ask the good folk there…</p>

<p>Less than fourty hours later, I had an answer so simple and elegant,
that I was literally grinning when I read it. It deserves quoting in
full. It is that ingenious.</p>

<blockquote><p>Set the “External Browser” option to
<code>sh -c 'echo "$0" | xsel'</code></p>

<p>You can use xsel -b to use the clipboard instead of the primary
selection. An alternative to
<a href="http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/" title="xsel homepage">xsel</a>
is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/" title="xclip homepage">xclip</a>
(xclip for the primary selection, xclip -selection CLIPBOARD for the
clipboard).</p>

<p>In <span class="file">~/.w3m/config</span>, that’s the extbrowser setting.
Then press M to copy (yank) the URL of the current page, or ESCM to
copy the URL of the link under the cursor.</p>

<p>You can use the second or third external browser for that instead;
then the key combination is 2M or 3M or 2ESCM or 3ESCM.
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12497/yanking-urls-in-w3m/12572#12572" title="THE answer">Gilles on Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This simple hack means that it is now trivial to yank either the URL of
the current page, or of the link under the cursor to primary selection.
It was just a matter then of adding some intuitive keybinds – as the <kbd>M</kbd>
and <kbd>Escape</kbd><kbd>M</kbd> combination are redolent of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war" title="Emacs vs Vi">the unamed editor</a>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'><span class="nb">keymap</span> <span class="k">y</span> EXTERN    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">br</span>/<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">keymap</span> Y EXTERN_LINK
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The perfect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" title="The UNIX philosophy on Wikipedia">UNIX solution</a>…</p>

<h4>Updated 8/5/11</h4>

<p>Gilles has edited and updated his answer with a slight change:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>sh -c <span class="s1">&#39;printf %s &quot;$0&quot; | xsel&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>This prevents a new line being appended.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/arch-elvis.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I have been using
<a href="http://surfraw.alioth.debian.org/" title="Surfraw manifesto">Surfraw</a> for the
better part of eighteen months, and I think that it is a perfect Unix
tool: it does <em>one</em> thing, extremely well… If you haven’t come across
it, Surfraw is a command-line interface to a couple of dozen
repositories of knowledge. It is described thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>It reclaims google, altavista, babelfish, dejanews, freshmeat,
research index, slashdot and many others from the false-prophet,
pox-infested heathen lands of html-forms, placing these wonders where
they belong, deep in unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the
shell.<sup>1</sup></p></blockquote>

<p>The shell scripts that power the searches of the repositories are called
<em>elvi</em>, the singular being <em>elvis</em>. Currently, in
<a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=surfraw/surfraw.git;a=summary" title="Debian Git Repo: Surfraw">the git repo</a>,
there are
<a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=surfraw/surfraw.git;a=tree;f=elvi;hb=HEAD" title="elvi in the git repo">over 100 elvi</a>,
ranging from Wikipedia through to the CIA website (yes, the project was
founded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange" title="Julian's Wikipedia page">Julian Assange</a>),
Slashdot and The Wayback Machine.</p>

<p>As comprehensive as the list of elvi is, there was one glaring hole.
Arch Linux is represented in terms of elvi to search the
<a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/" title="Arch User Repository">AUR</a> and the
<a href="http://www.archlinux.org/packages/" title="Arch Package Database">official package repositories</a>,
but nothing for the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_Page" title="Definitive Arch Linux documentation">Arch Wiki</a>,
perhaps the best GNU/Linux reference wiki on the web.</p>

<p>So I thought I would rectify that.</p>

<p>You can grab the archwiki elvis from my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/241da582a0fd/.config/surfraw/elvi/archwiki" title="mercurial repo">mercurial repo</a>,
copy it into your local directory at <span class="file">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/surfraw/elvi/</span> or
in the system folder at <span class="file">$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/surfraw/</span> and you can surf the
Arch Wiki, or any one of the nine other language wikis, from the command
line.</p>

<blockquote><p>Surfrawize the soul of your favourite internet wonder. Join the
<strong>S</strong>hell <strong>U</strong>sers’ <strong>R</strong>evolutionary <strong>F</strong>ront <strong>A</strong>gainst the
WW<strong>W</strong> by submitting code. Reclaim heathen lands. Bear witness to the
truth. Its love will set you free.</p></blockquote>
