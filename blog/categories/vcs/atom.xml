<p>I have previously posted about using
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/02/10/using-mercurial-to-share-dotfiles/" title="My post on using mercurial">Mercurial to share dotfiles</a>,
and how I have been using
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/" title="bitbucket homepage">bitbucket</a> as a free host
for that service.</p>

<p>Recently, I came across
<a href="http://beta.intuxication.org/" title="Free mercurial hosting">Intuxication</a>,
who describe themselves thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>Intuxication provides a free, fast and lightweight platform to host
your Mercurial repositories.</p></blockquote>

<p>You will see from their URL that they are only in beta, but the service—while
undeniably rough around the edges—looks quite promising.</p>

<p>For small projects, the limit is 1GB disk space, Intuxication provides
all of the basic features you need to maintain a mercurial repository.</p>

<p>One of the advantages it has over bitbucket is that the default
stylesheet makes it much easier to read the files that you host. And
while there are obviously plans to introduce more styles (from the
Configure menu you can select a dropdown of five different styles),
currently only one works.</p>

<p>If I had any criticism at all, it would be that the unfinished nature of
the website (like the broken styles and the fact that quite a few of the
other features like that don’t work) means that it feels a lot more like
an alpha than a beta.</p>

<p>However, I’m sure that with time and some support (there is a donate
button on every page), Intuxication will continue to develop. I think it
is a site with potential, and I’m currently pushing my
<a href="http://beta.intuxication.org/jasonwryan/archer/browse/tip/" title="EeePC tip">EeePC dotfiles</a>
there.</p>

    <updated>2010-02-10T20:36:00+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonwryan.github.com/blog/2010/02/10/using-mercurial-to-share-dotfiles</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I posted a couple of weeks back about
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/01/11/using-dropbox-to-share-dotfiles/">using dropbox to share dotfiles</a>
and while I am pleased with how well that works, I had always intended to see how well a
version control system would handle that (relatively trivial) chore.</p>

<p>I chose <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> only because it is the
system used by <a href="http://suckless.org/">the suckless community</a> and, as their
<a href="http://suckless.org/manifest/">philosophy</a> and the products they
produce are of such exceptional quality, no further investigation seemed
necessary.</p>

<p>Installing mercurial, on both my Arch machines and the Ubuntu box was simple
enough:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1&gt;pacman -S mercurial&lt;/h1&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Then, rather than use my <span class="file">/home</span> directory as the local repo
(which for some reason—probably completely irrational—seemed somewhat risky),
I opted to create the repository in a separate directory in my home folder and
link to the relevant files.</p>

<p>I signed up for a free account at <a href="http://bitbucket.org">bitbucket</a> and created a repository
called “dotfiles.”</p>

<p>The it was just a matter of cloning the new repository to my local
machine:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>hg clone https://jasonwryan@bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/dotfiles/
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>and then entering the newly created directory and linking to the files that
I wanted to share:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd </span>dotfiles/ ln /home/jason/.Xdefaults ln /home/jason/.apvlvrc
</span><span class='line'>…
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Note: I initially tried symlinking, but Mercurial didn't like that
<em>at all</em>, hence the hard links…</p>

<p>Then it was just a matter of telling Mercurial that the requisite files
are in the folder:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>hg add
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Commit the changes:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>hg ci
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>…and then push the changes to the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/">bitbucket repository</a>:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>hg push
</span></code></pre></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>This was certainly a lot quicker to setup than the Dropbox method but, for
all that I am using it for, it seems a little like overkill. I'll chalk
it up as a good way for me to get my head around <acronym title="Version
Control Systems">vcs</acronym> more than anything else…</p>

<h3>The Mercurial Book</h3>

<p>For more information on Mercurial, I highly
recommend Bryan O'Sullivan's excellent
<a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/">Mercurial: The Definitive Guide</a>.</p>

<h4>Update</h4>

<p>Post edited to reflect that fact that I now run two repos,
one for the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/workstation/src/"
title="work machine repo" target="_blank">workstation</a> (as described here),
and a second one for my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/"
title="Netbook repo" target="_blank">EeePC</a> – which I did successfully
create in <span class="file">/home</span> without any apocalyptic consequences.</p>
