<p>I am frequently struck by how many people arrive on the
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/" title="Arch Linux Forums">Arch boards</a> without <em>any</em>
understanding of how Arch is different from the other GNU/Linux communities
they may have spent time with (if, indeed, they have spent any time in
another community before trying Arch). For me, this is akin to arriving in a
foreign country and not bothering to familiarize yourself at all with the local
mores and customs; it lies on a spectrum somewhere between ignorance and
outright arrogance.</p>

<p>The result, inevitably, is that these people are shocked
when their expectations of how they <em>should</em> be treated are at odds with the
reception their behaviour invites…</p>

<p>Before venturing any further, I should preface my remarks about this with
something of a disclaimer. These are my own views and not those of the current,
or past, forum staff.</p>

<p>One of Arch's significant acheivements is the quality of
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org" title="THE best GNU/Linux Wiki">its documentation</a>.
Not just the technical documentation describing how to install and configure
Arch, but the cultural documentation that sets out
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way" title="The Arch Way">Arch's philosophy</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Forum_Etiquette" title="Forum Etiquette">standards of behaviour</a>. Both these pages provide clear statements on what to expect when
using Arch Linux and a clear indication of how to respectfully interact with the
community when you are seeking help.</p>

<p>The defining statement about Arch's intended user base is quite direct and
unambiguous:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Arch Linux targets and accommodates competent GNU/Linux users<br/>by giving them complete control and responsibility over the system.</p><footer><strong>The Arch Way</strong> <cite><a href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way#User-centric'>wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>The expression “targets and accommodates” doesn't exclude other users—for
example, those that are not necessarily competent, but are wanting to learn
more about the specifics of how their machines work—it does, however, signal
quite explicitly what sort of community Arch is. And what it is not.</p>

<p><a href="http://ubuntu.com" title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu</a> is an excellent distribution. Like Arch,
it has very specific aims and a clear concept of what the Ubuntu community is.
Popularity is central to Ubuntu's culture. People coming from Ubuntu, who
haven't bothered to familiarize themselves with Arch's values, often struggle
to appreciate the difference; leading to comments like this one:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Maybe if Arch is friendly and Arch forum is friendly, it might go some<br/>place, who knows…</p><footer><strong>Linux Journal commenter</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/arch-way#comment-361974'>www.linuxjournal.com/content/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>This was posted in reply to a post on Arch in which the author noted how to
seek help with Arch Linux:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>You'll find far less hand-holding on the Arch Forums than some of the other<br/>distro's forums, and for good reason.  Arch has one of the most informative,<br/>user-friendly wiki's out there. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT ask a question in the<br/>forums or on IRC without searching the wiki and the forums first.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Similarly, looking through the threads in
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewforum.php?id=23" title="Newbie board">Newbie Corner</a>
will periodically turn up new posters who are indignant at being told to
<acronym title="Read The Fscking Manual">RTFM</acronym> and see it as some
sort of <em>personal</em> attack, when in fact it is just someone pointing out the
obvious to them. The community hasn't compiled all that documentation just
so they can sit around and regurgitate answers for people who are either
unwilling or incapable of making the minimum amount of  effort required to
solve their own problems…</p>

<p>If you want handholding, there are plenty of online communities that will
cater for you. If you install Arch and think that you are automatically entitled
to immediate support for issues that you encounter, then you are mistaken.
If you think that Arch will suffer if you don't get what you want, then
your problems extend significantly beyond your choice of distro.</p>

<p>The community has worked hard over the years to keep the signal-to-noise ratio
on the boards high, that way, the forums remain a helpful resource for the community,
not a breeding ground for
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/03/17/vampires/" title="Post on parasites…">help vampires</a>.</p>

<p>If you have spent any time at all amongst online (or, for that matter,
off-line) communities, you will be familiar with the help vampire. If,
by some combination of fortune and ignorance, you haven’t come across
this term before, read Amy Hoy’s original—and definitive—
<a href="http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/" title="Amy's blog on help vampires">post on this scourge</a>,
<em>now</em>.</p>

<p>Amy has some excellent tips on identifying help vampires, however, since
she originally shed some sunlight on this odious species, they have
become even more cunning and have adapted; to the point where there are
now several varieties that you should be wary of if you are determined
to prevent your online community from becoming overrun with them.</p>

<p><strong>The Infant</strong> The easiest to spot because, due to their nascent form,
they have not developed sophisticated anti-detection strategies as yet.
Also, encouragingly, these are the most likely to respond to the
corrective measures Amy outlines in her post.</p>

<p>The infant has probably learned their dependant ways in some other
online community with a higher tolerance for their spoonfeeding needs.
Corrective measures, vigorously and repeatedly applied <em>can</em> turn them
around; but even small amounts of reinforcement of this behaviour can
quickly see them morph into one of the more sinister types…</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m10ce18Jda1qz8s9s.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p><strong>The Leech</strong> This reprehensible lifeform just sucks and sucks and
<em>sucks</em> until there is nothing left. Some of their forum threads may
even appear reasonable, but looking at their profile in totality tells a
shocking story. All of their posts are in their own threads, they are
not interested in helping anyone else with a problem. They will move
remorselessly from issue to issue, expecting the community to provide
answers for them at a hemorrhagic rate.</p>

<p>They won’t have made any edits to
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org" title="The BEST godamn GNU/Linux wiki on the web">the Wiki</a>,
no matter how trivial. They won’t
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org" title="Arch User repository">maintain any packages</a> or donate
any time or
<a href="http://www.archlinux.org/donate/" title="Donate now and recieve a FREE package update!">money</a>
to your community. But they will be there night after night, posting
their problems and waiting for the hapless to expend their time and
energy on them. Like all parasites, they will adapt over time so remain
vigilant.</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/vampire3.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p><strong>The Fanger</strong> The out-and-out help vampire, unabashed and unashamed of
their <em>needs</em>. Their sense of entitlement will be telegraphed by needy
and demanding thread titles, often featuring exhortations like “HELP”
and “URGENT” and almost always embellished with a liberal—and, at times
of “real crises,” exclusive—use of all caps and exclamation marks.</p>

<p>The Fanger will also occasionally table (sadly, almost inevitably empty)
threats about leaving your community and going off to use some other
software; as if the dependency relationship is somehow reversed and it
is you, the community, that will suffer if they leave.</p>

<p>The other classic trait of the hardcore vampire is that, like their
fictional avatars, they see nothing when a mirror is held up to them.
You can call their behaviour as much as you like, it will have no
effect. Your only solution here is technology:
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/suspension-ban-or-hellban.html" title="Coding Horror on the Hell Ban">the hell ban</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Arch Linux community has grown considerably since it emerged
<a href="http://www.archlinux.org/news/arch-linux-turns-10/" title="w00t!">ten years ago this month</a>. Over
the last couple of years, the forums in particular have seen a lot of
new users signing up to participate. This is unquestionably a good
thing™</p>

<p>However, Arch is clearly labelled as being for
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way#User-centric" title="The Arch Way: user-centric">competent users</a>
(and here competent can equally mean accomplished – or prepared to
invest in themselves and the community to become competent) and that
means not enabling these sorts of vampiric behaviours, in whatever form
they manifest.</p>
