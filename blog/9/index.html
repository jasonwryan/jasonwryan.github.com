  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/key-board.jpg" title="Encrypted mail" >
With the torrent of recent revelations about the enthusiasm with which
the governments of most of the first world have been systematically and
unlawfully violating the privacy of their citizens by intercepting their digital
communications, I thought it worth adding to the posts I have written about
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/categories/mutt/" title="Posts on mutt">Mutt</a>—that most
peerless of email clients—specifically how, combined with
<a href="http://gnupg.org/" title="GPG home page">GnuPG</a>, you can encrypt all of your mail and
ensure that the only person reading it is the intended recipient.</p>

<p>The definitive guide for this setup remains Justin Miller&rsquo;s venerable page,
<a href="http://codesorcery.net/old/mutt/mutt-gnupg-howto" title="The title says it all, really…">Everything You Need To Know To Start Using GnuPG with Mutt</a>,
last edited in 2001 and <em>still</em> the authoritative source. The setup I will
describe differs only insofar as it covers how to use multiple keys associated
with different mail accounts. Mutt gives you the flexibility sign or encrypt all
of the email in your work account with one key, and your personal email with
another.</p>

<p>Once you have set up your GPG keys<sup>1</sup>, the first step is to configure
Mutt to use your keys. You can include these directives in your
<span class="file">muttrc</span> but, in the interests of readability, I prefer
to split them out into <span class="file">gpg.rc</span> and source them from
<span class="file">muttrc</span>. The settings are self-explanatory, those most
relevant to this post control how mutt handles your mail with respect to
encryption or just signing<sup>2</sup>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">pgp_use_gpg_agent</span> <span class="o">=</span> yes
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">pgp_sign_as</span> <span class="o">=</span> 43A5CE95
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">pgp_timeout</span> <span class="o">=</span> 3600
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">crypt_autosign</span> <span class="o">=</span> yes
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">crypt_replyencrypt</span> <span class="o">=</span> yes
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This sets my work key as the primary key and a couple of other sane (for me)
defaults. All of these options are described in <code>muttrc(5)</code>.
You can see my complete file in my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/default/.mutt/gpg.rc" title="mutt config files">bitbucket repo</a>.</p>

<p>The rest of the recipe is in <span class="file">muttrc</span>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">source</span> ~/.mutt/gpg.rc            <span class="c"># use GPG</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># gpg key</span>
</span><span class='line'>send-hook <span class="s2">&quot;~f @catalyst.net.nz&quot;</span>  <span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">pgp_sign_as</span><span class="o">=</span>43A5CE95
</span><span class='line'>send-hook <span class="s2">&quot;~f @jasonwryan.com&quot;</span>   <span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">pgp_sign_as</span><span class="o">=</span>B1BD4E40
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># key binds</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">bind </span>compose p  pgp-menu
</span><span class='line'>macro compose Y pfy <span class="s2">&quot;send mail without GPG&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Sourcing the <span class="file">gpg.rc</span> reads all the relevant options
and then a series of <code>send-hooks</code> allow you to use specific keys for each of
your accounts.</p>

<p>Now, when you receive encrypted mail, if your key agent is running, Mutt will
decrypt your mail on the fly. Otherwise you will be prompted for your key
phrase. Similarly, when you send email, it will by default be signed by the key
associated with that account, and you can encrypt individual mail by bringing up
the GPG menu in the compose screen by hitting <kbd>p</kbd>.</p>

<p>And for those friends and acquaintances you correspond with for whom
encryption is the equivalent of white powder spilling from an envelope, you can
always elect to send without any GPG by selecting <kbd>Y</kbd> to send the
email.</p>

<p>These and a number of other interesting tips and macros are on the
<a href="http://dev.mutt.org/trac/wiki/MuttGuide/UseGPG" title="Using GPG">Mutt Wiki</a>
and are worth following up once you have the basics working. Like so much of
this sort of software, it takes a little longer to set up <em>exactly</em> the way that
you want it, but once you are done, it is good for decades…</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>A good introduction to this procedure is detailed in the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPG">Arch Wiki article</a>.</li>
<li>This assumes that you do want to distinguish between the two; you could, of
course, just encrypt <em>everything</em>—assuming that your correspondents were
willing and able to decrypt it…</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/raspberry-pi-logo.png" title="Raspberry Pi logo" >
I was fortunate enough to be given a
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" title="Pi homepage">Raspberry Pi</a> earlier this year
and, naturally enough, have been running
<a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/" title="Arch Linux ARM site">Arch ARM</a> on it over the
last several months. Initially, I was at somewhat of a loss as to what to do
with it, so was just (under)using it<sup>1</sup> for a persistent IRC connection.
I have now, with very little effort, set it up as a headless torrent box and it is
working nicely.</p>

<p>As is generally the case, this involved little more than stitching together a
few lightweight tools to accomplish the task. In this case, it is a combination
of
<a href="http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/" title="rotrrent homepage">rtorrent</a>
(with the canvas-colour patch applied),
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/categories/surfraw/" title="Posts on surfraw">surfraw</a>
and
<a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/" title="w3m homepage">w3m</a> for discovering
torrents,<sup>2</sup>
<a href="http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html" title="Peer to Peer synching">bittorrent sync</a>
and, optionally, a <acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym>.</p>

<p>I use a 16GB <acronym title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</acronym> drive to act as
storage for the device, and mount it at <span class="file">~/Downloads</span>
via <span class="file">/etc/fstab</span>; depending on the size of your
<acronym title="Secure Digital">SD card</acronym>, this may be superfluous.</p>

<p>First a note on building packages; building <em>anything</em> on the Pi—with only
512MB <acronym title="Random Access Memory">RAM</acronym>—is a protracted
and thankless task. So if you intend to do more of this, or do it regularly,
set up
<a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/developers/distcc-cross-compiling" title="Arch ARM instructions">cross-compiling</a>;
you won&rsquo;t regret the initial investment.</p>

<p><code>rtorrent</code> is in the ARM repos, but I wanted to patch in colour, so I wrote
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jasonwryan/5794623" title="Gist of the thing…">a PKGBUILD</a>,
based on the package in [community] and
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=31956" title="Arch User Repository">ashren&rsquo;s AUR package</a>.
Once you have rtorrent installed and working, the rest is straightforward.</p>

<p>The default config for w3m is perfectly functional, but can be easily customized
further. The key to this setup is being able to find a torrent and then easily
add it to rtorrent&rsquo;s queue.  To do this, I modified the hack that I wrote up
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2011/05/05/w3m/" title="Post on yanking URLs in w3m">a couple years back</a>.
Essentially, you use w3m&rsquo;s external link function to trigger a script to grab
the magnet link. Like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>~/.w3m/config </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>extbrowser /home/jason/Scripts/magnets %s
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and the script from the
<a href="http://wiki.rtorrent.org/MagnetUri#Handling_.22magnet:.22_URIs_via_a_bash_script" title="Script for magnet links">rtorrent wiki</a>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>~/Scripts/magnets </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/Downloads/Queue/watch/    <span class="c"># set your watch directory here</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">[[</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$1&quot;</span> <span class="o">=</span>~ <span class="nv">xt</span><span class="o">=</span>urn:btih:<span class="o">([</span>^&amp;/<span class="o">]</span>+<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">]]</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nb">exit</span>;
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;d10:magnet-uri${#1}:${1}e&quot;</span> &gt; <span class="s2">&quot;meta-${BASH_REMATCH[1]}.torrent&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Remapping the w3m key to trigger the script to make it more Vim-like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>~/.w3m/keymap </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>keymap Y EXTERN_LINK
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And now hitting <kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>y</kbd> over a magnet link adds it to your
queue.</p>

<p>The final piece was to ameliorate the step of transferring the completed files
from the Pi, or for allowing me to add torrents remotely. To do this, I used
a <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/03/16/sync/" title="My post on Sync">bittorrent sync</a>
shared directory as <span class="file">~/Downloads</span>. All files are synched
to my desktop as they are downloaded to the Pi. Simple.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/rtorrent-2.png" title="'Screenshot of rtorrent in action…'" ></p>

<p>As I mentioned above, you could also use a VPN and, with a service
file, have it connect on boot if you wished to further protect your privacy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/bowl.jpg" title="'Flickr image of Begging Bowl'" >
Another great peristaltic movement in Arch&rsquo;s rolling release digestive system
happened over the last couple of weeks, the move of all binaries
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/news/binaries-move-to-usrbin-requiring-update-intervention/" title="Arch News update">to /usr/bin</a>.
This move had been foreshadowed for several months and, despite announcements
on the front page of the Arch website, the mailing lists and the release going
through [testing] and the resulting thread on the forums, there was still a
surprising amount of carnage<sup>1</sup> in it&rsquo;s wake.</p>

<p>In the aftermath (although I expect that it will take some months for it to
completely pass through the system), what struck me was not so much the variety
and ingenuity of the ways people had managed to break their installs<sup>2</sup>
as how they approached the community seeking help afterwards.</p>

<p>There are already some fine guides on how to do this, notably
ESR&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" title="Just read it…">How to ask Questions the Smart Way</a>
and—specifically for Arch—zendeavour&rsquo;s
<a href="http://redd.it/tjjwr" title="On Reddit">troubleshooting for newcomers</a>;
this isn&rsquo;t an attempt to add or expand on that genre. Rather, it is
a look at a subset of attitudes that some people adopt<sup>3</sup>
as they seek the assistance of the community.</p>

<p>The first is the <strong>blamer</strong>. The proponent of the  “all-guns-blazing” approach.
I&rsquo;ll paraphrase, but there are enough examples on the boards to illustrate the
point: “my system can&rsquo;t boot, it&rsquo;s not my fault and I am here to let you know
that I am unhappy and demand recourse.” This is, unquestionably, the most
puzzling of all the strategies. It is often coupled with the (sadly almost
always empty) threat to abandon the distro and it&rsquo;s apparently beleaguered
community.</p>

<p>Puzzling because I have yet to encounter a single situation in life, online
or off, where opening with hostility and blame is an intelligent approach to
seeking assistance. If you are going to adopt this approach, please supersize
to “rage quit” and expend your energy actually delivering on your threat.</p>

<p>The next is the <strong>wheedler</strong>. Less objectionable than the incendiary approach,
it is nonetheless similarly ineffective. Wheedlers are distinguished by
peppering their posts liberally with declarations of their ineptitude and
“noobness”, in the mistaken belief that this will engender a wave of sympathy
prior to soothing hand-holding and spoon-feeding. There is a strong correlation
between this behaviour and the various types of
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/03/17/vampires/" title="Post on the taxonomy of vampires">help vampirism</a>.</p>

<p>Wheedling won&rsquo;t lead to quicker, or more informed, advice and assistance; in
all likelihood it will just discourage others from helping because
they can see that rewarding this sort of behaviour has a longer-term
deleterious impact on the health of the community.</p>

<p>Then there is the <strong>Vulcan</strong>. A curiosity more than an annoyance, these
people seem to inhabit some sort of adolescent fantasy land where the Internet
is a venue for them to revel in their almost superhero-like powers of technical
<em>awesomeness</em>; said powers manifesting to others as a sort of benign
cluelessness.</p>

<p>Their posts are invariably brief and completely devoid of relevant detail to the
point of cryptic because, “hey, we all <em>know</em> what this issue is,” and are
littered with smilies and that stupid emoticon with the sunglasses. Rather than
actually describing their problem, they want people to think that, by a process
of <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Vulcan_mind_meld" title="There is a Star Trek wiki?">mind-melding</a>,
other “hackers” will intuit the subtle depth and intricacy of the issue and
then type out a detailed step-by-step guide of how to solve it.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the <strong>conspiracist</strong>. These malcontents see every
significant change in Arch as being part of a wider agenda to corrupt the purity
of the UNIX® philosophy. They also tend to blame
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Poettering" title="Lennarts wikipedia page">Lennart Poettering</a>
for <em>everything</em>. These unfortunates are clearly already suffering such mental anguish
trying to reconcile their obsessiveness about the past with a rolling
release that they deserve our pity more than our contempt (but I am equally
happy providing either)…</p>

<p>As I said, these are fortunately just a subset and very much represent the
minority of attitudes.  The vast majority tend to be aware that, at
one time or another, <em>everyone</em> will need some help to solve a problem.
Therefore it is best to approach it in a matter-of-fact way, using the practical
guidance on asking questions on a technical forum, and with a degree of humility
and a willingness to learn from the people who are prepared to share their
knowledge and experience.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>Where “carnage” should be understood as a minor PEBKAC epidemia…</li>
<li>From shutting down mid-update (because a reboot fixes <em>everything</em>) to
still using <code>consolekit</code>, <code>initscripts</code> and <code>grub-legacy</code>: all deprecated some time
ago.</li>
<li>I resisted linking to specific posts on the boards to provide actual examples,
the more motivated among you will find them without difficulty.</li>
