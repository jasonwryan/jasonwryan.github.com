<div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/troll.jpg" title="'Troll on Flickr'" >
I posted recently about
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/08/04/systemd/" title="Some thoughts on moving across…">my experiences shifting to systemd</a>
and how I found it, for all three of my Arch machines, to be a relatively simple and
straightforward process which, in the intervening weeks, has borne out the views of
the developers and other members of the community who have been using it for a longer
period—it works, and works well. At the start of this week, Stéphane Gaudreault
announced on Arch-dev-public the intention to
<a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2012-August/023389.html" title="ML post seeking developer views">replace the original initscripts with systemd</a>.</p>

<p>The reaction by some to this announcement was, to me, quite disappointing. My view of
open source communities is that by participating you are entering into a social contract.
That contract is that, as you are reliant on the goodwill of the wider community it is
incumbent on you to ensure that your overall contribution—in whatever form—brings
more to the community than it takes away. At the very least, you can strive to ensure
that it is a value neutral exchange.</p>

<p>Sadly, for some of the trolls on the <acronym title="Mailing lists">MLs</acronym>, that
is patently not the case. I want to take a closer look at just one of those threads, for two
reasons. First, it is a textbook case of a particularly pernicious troll. And second, in
conjunction with some other factors, it had an especially damaging effect on the wider
community.</p>

<p>The thread in question is on Arch-general, the largest of the mailing lists. It has
the suitably alarmist title
<a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2012-August/029856.html" title="A trolling we will go…">Think twice before moving to systemd</a>.
The troll, who has had only minimal involvement with the Arch community up until this
unfortunate moment starts by framing his “concern”<sup>1</sup>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I just became aware that Arch Linux plans to switch to systemd, and this worries me for several reasons.</p><footer><strong>Felipe Contreras</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>Felipe is worried. Ergo, <em>we</em> should be worried. Why should we be worried? Because,
despite the fact that systemd has been discussed and used by Archers since the
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=96316" title="57 page thread on the Arch BBS">middle of 2010</a>,
it has just come to his attention and now, with the formidable powers of his intellect,
he has detected a disturbance in the force.</p>

<blockquote><p>I tried systemd a while ago in a brand new machine with Arch Linux and the boot was *much slower*. After some exchanges with Lennart Poettering and other people in Google+[1], it became clear I was on my own. Eventually I found the culprit: Fedora uses CONFIG_HZ_1000, and Arch Linux uses CONFIG_HZ_300. It became clear to me that systemd was not ready for prime time, it wasn't thoroughly tested in a lot of machines, and if you have problems Lennart Poettering will blame you (PulseAudio sounds familiar?).</p><footer><strong>Felipe Contreras</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>The salient phrases here are “it became clear I was on my own” and the even more telling,
“it became clear to me that systemd was not ready for prime time.” Once I had managed to
wipe away the tears of gratitude that were coursing down my cheeks, I realized that Arch
finally had finally found what it had been missing for all these years: a saviour. We
were going to be OK after all.</p>

<p>Felipe has “found the culprit.” Despite the best efforts of the Arch developers, upstream,
the other distros that have been using it for considerably longer, and the experience of the
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1147676" title="Thread on systemd - one of many">Arch users reported on our boards</a>,
no-one had the heroic ability to see through to the heart of this conundrum and expose
systemd for the fraud that it is.</p>

<p>But our gratitude should be tempered with some shame for we, the Arch community, have let
Felipe down. We haven&rsquo;t lived up to the standards he expects of us. As he gently admonishes us:
“I was expecting more from the Arch Linux community.” Yes, Felipe, and you were right to.
We let you down; can you forgive us?</p>

<p>The thread goes on to generate more than 50 replies. All of them wasted.
His trolling is not interested in facts, in reason or logic; his method of argumentation is
not rational, and he is not interested in working toward an understanding
of the truth; he just wants to be right. At whatever cost to the wider community. These posts,
and trolls in other fora
<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/4/12/434" title="LKML exchange with Linus Torvalds">like this one</a>,<sup>2</sup>
are really about gratifying Felipe&rsquo;s own voracious appetite for self-aggrandisement. In reality,
of course, it is a stunning illustration of the
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" title="Wikipedia entry">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>.
It would be pathetic if it were a victimless pursuit; but it is not.</p>

<p>Further down in the thread we see the inevitable frustration of the developer who leads
this work for Arch,
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/developers/#tomegun" title="Tom's developer profile">Tom Gunderson</a>,
finally <a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2012-August/029933.html" title="Tom's reply quoting Linus">boil over</a>.
This precipitates another thread where Tom announces that he will
<a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2012-August/029960.html" title="Tom's mail to the list">no longer participate in this list</a>.
This is from the developer that has patiently and constructively engaged with Arch users on the
list around this issue for the past several months. On his own time.</p>

<p>That is the impact of trolls like Felipe. That is a direct effect of his selfishness on the
wider community. What has he brought to the community? Dissent, distraction and posturing.
What has he taken away? The ability for all of us to engage with one of the developers
of the software we all use. His presence on the list, and that of a few others,
has been nothing short of corrosive.</p>

<p>And as for the smoking gun, the config setting that no-one was smart enough to
discover? Denis A. Altoé Falqueto went to the trouble to build another kernel
and run a test and, contrary to Felipe who provided no such evidence,
<a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2012-August/030145.html" title="Denis' post">posted the results</a>.
You can guess the outcome.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>See the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=concern+troll">concern troll</a>.</li>
<li>Read the whole thread to fully understand how obstinance can trump reason… See
also his <a href="http://felipec.wordpress.com/2012/05/26/no-mercurial-branches-are-still-not-better-than-git-ones-response-to-jhws-more-on-mercurial-vs-git-with-graphs/">own blog</a>
where he expresses incredulity that his comments on another blog have been deleted.</li>
