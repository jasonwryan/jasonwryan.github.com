I posted a couple of weeks ago about the impact of some of the current
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/07/19/breakage/" title="Post on the glibc change">changes to Arch Linux</a>.
There seems to be quite a bit of it about, because in conjunction with the move from
<span class="file">/lib</span> to <span class="file">/usr/lib</span>—and motivated by the same
overarching shifts in the other distributions—the other major change making its way through
the Arch community is the move to
<a href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd" title="Project page">systemd</a>. This change, however, has
been more controversial because it marks a shift away from Arch&#8217;s central configuration
file, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rc.conf" title="Arch wiki entry on rc.conf">/etc/rc.conf</a>;
a move that has disconcerted a number of people.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to get into whether or not this move is consistent with
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way" title="Wiki entry">The Arch Way</a>, because that has
been thrashed over extensively on the
<a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2012-July/023283.html" title="ML thread on rc.conf">mailing</a>
<a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2012-July/023258.html" title="And another one…">lists</a>,
but also—and more importantly—because Arch is a rolling release, which means change is <em>inevitable</em>.
What is more, after watching all the back and forth on the <acronym title="Mailing lists">ML</acronym>
and on the <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=96316&amp;p=1" title="Arch BBS thread on systemd">boards</a>, I am convinced that the
<a href="http://www.archlinux.org/developers/#tomegun" title="Tom Gunderson">developer overseeing this shift</a>
both knows what he is doing and is acting in the best interests of Arch.</p>

<p>This view has been validated by my experience of shifting to systemd on my machines.</p>

<p>When the new initscripts package was pushed to [testing] in the middle of last month,
I stripped out all of the redundant options in <span class="file">/etc/rc.conf</span>
and took the ten minutes or so to read about and then create the new files. I then spent some
time reading up on systemd, principally
<a href="http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/systemd-for-admins-1.html" title="One of TWELVE…">Lennart Poettering&#8217;s series of posts</a>,
the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd" title="Good, but needing some structure">Arch wiki entry</a>
and the many and various
<a href="http://0pointer.de/public/systemd-man/" title="One for everything">manual pages</a>.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of days, I have migrated all of my machines over to systemd. I found it
to be a very straightforward process. I went for a pure systemd approach, for reasons I will
return to. Essentially, this is how I tackled it.</p>

<p>First, for each machine, I established what daemons were running. I did this by using
<a href="http://pikacode.com/jasonwryan/Veles/file/default/Scripts/daemons.sh" title="Pretty sure it is one of Xyne's">this shell script</a>
and cross checking entries in my <span class="file">/etc/rc.conf</span>. Then
it was just a matter of installing systemd:<sup>1</sup></p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>sudo pacman -S systemd systemd-sysvcompat systemd-arch-units
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>The only outstanding file to be created was <span class="file">/etc/timezone</span>, the
others—all documented in <code>man rc.conf</code>—I had created earlier in the month. Then, with the
list of the services I would need running on each box, I enabled them. I think it is
fair to say that the only thing that is clunky about systemd is the command syntax for
managing units. Repeatedly typing <code>systemctl enable foo.service</code> is as tedious as it is
error prone, so I hacked up a
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/centurion/src/default/Scripts/sysd" title="sysd - *so* much easier">wrapper script</a>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>sysd <span class="nb">enable </span>acpid
</span><span class='line'>sysd <span class="nb">enable </span>lvm
</span><span class='line'>etc…
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>I also activated some additional gettys, as I like to log into a tmux session in TTY2 when
I don&#8217;t need or want to start <code>X</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>ln -sf /usr/lib/systemd/system/getty@.service /etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants/getty@tty2.service
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>And I misguidedly wrote a couple of custom service files that turned out to be
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=146207" title="BBS post on said files">completely unnecessary</a>;
and then I was done.</p>

<p>On all three boxes I rebooted and that was it. The only issue I experienced was
the final shutdown after removing initscripts and before booting up with
systemd. After issuing <code>shutdown -r now</code> the process
hung with a message about a missing <span class="file">inittab</span> file.
In retrospect, I should have added <code>init=/bin/systemd</code> to my kernel parameters
and not unistalled instiscripts until I had booted with systemd. This has
now been added to the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd" title="Archwiki systemd page">systemd wiki page</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, though: no real drama, just a blur of text<sup>2</sup> and then the
login prompt. While I haven&#8217;t seen a dramatic decrease in boot time,
booting does <em>feel</em> a bit snappier and two of my three machines shutdown
markedly more quickly. Consider me sold.</p>

<p>That brings me back to the decision to opt for a pure systemd approach, rather than
hanging on to a completely eviscerated <span class="file">/etc/rc.conf</span>. The
Arch community has been told that the intention is to
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1133957#p1133957" title="BBS post by tomegun">support the rc.conf format forever</a>;
I can&#8217;t help but think this is a mistake. In the same way that
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported" title="Pacman entry on Arch Wiki">partial upgrades are unsupported</a>,
I think that systemd is Arch&#8217;s inevitable future and the community should be encouraged to accept that, <code>Syu</code> and
move on…</p>

<p>Having said that, I appreciate the consideration shown by the developers in wanting to assure
people that their choice would continue to be catered for; and perhaps, over time, people still
using initscripts will be regarded with the same sense of wry amusement as those who still show
up from time to time with <code>hal</code> in their <code>DAEMONS</code> line.</p>

<h3>Update 4/8/12</h3>

<p>Tom Gunderson, the developer who looks after this part of Arch, has clarified the
comment about the long term support for initscripts. As comments are hosted on
a third-party paltform, I thought that it should be included in the body of the
post.</p>

<blockquote><p>Just a clarification: regarding the (probably very unwise) promise of &#8220;supporting <span="file">rc.conf</span> forever&#8221;, the intended meaning was that initscripts will support the syntax, not that initscripts themselves will always stay around (nor that systemd will gain support for the syntax in case initscripts is dropped).</p><p>At the moment systemd <strong>does</strong> support <span class="file">rc.conf</span> (when installed in conjunction with initscripts), but this is meant as a transitional measure only, and will likely go away eventually (though probably not soon).</p></blockquote>


<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>Note this approach will <em>remove</em> sysvinit and initscripts and <code>mv /etc/rc.conf{,.pacsave}</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure you remove <code>quiet</code> from your kernel parameters for your first systemd
boot so you can see that everything starts correctly…</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/guard.jpg" title="'On Guard image on Flickr'" >
In my last post, on
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/07/24/queues/" title="You should read it…">Mercurial Queues</a>,
I outlined how you might use MQ to manage a
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/" title="Dynamic window manager">dwm</a> patchset.
Mercurial makes this process ridiculously easy, and this functionality is more
than enough to recommend it. However, where I think it really gets interesting
is when you share that same patchset across multiple machines and are easily
able to customize which patches in the queue are applied, based upon the
particular machine you are building dwm on.</p>

<p>For example, in my case I use dwm on all three of my machines: my desktop at home,
my laptop at work and my EeePC. Given the nature of each of these three machines,
though, I want a slightly different stack of patches applied. These differences
might extend only to particular rules applied in <span class="file">config.def.h</span>
based upon the number of tags I use, or the different applications that I run
at home as opposed to at work.</p>

<p>In any event, what I want to be able to do is maintain
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/dwm-patchset/src/default/" title="Patchset in Bitbucket">a single patchset</a>
in a mercurial repository, clone it to all my machines and then, using MQ,
filter which specific patches are applied. This is all possible using a killer
feature of MQ called
<a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/advanced-uses-of-mercurial-queues.html%20'Advanced%20uses%20of%20MQ%20in%20the%20Mercurial%20book">guards</a>.
Guards allow you to conditionally apply patches in a queue. Essentially, in
a queue, you “tag” a patch with a guard and—depending on whether or not the
guard is positive (to be applied), or negative (to be skipped)—when you
<code>hg qpush -a</code> MQ takes care of applying the correct patches in the queue.</p>

<p>So, in the case of my work laptop, I begin by cloning dwm and intializing
a patch queue:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd </span>Build/
</span><span class='line'>hg clone http://hg.suckless.org/dwm
</span><span class='line'>hg qinit -c
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>I setup my <span class="file">.hgrc</span> within the patches directory so that
it points at the correct mercurial repository:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>.hg/patches/.hg/hgrc </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'> <span class="c"># Mercurial config file</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>ui<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">username</span> <span class="o">=</span> jasonwryan &lt;jasonwryan@gmail.com&gt;
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">ssh</span> <span class="o">=</span> ssh -i ~/.ssh/bb -C
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>paths<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">default</span> <span class="o">=</span> ssh://hg@bitbucket.com/jasonwryan/dwm-patchset
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>Then I pull down my dwm patchset from the mercurial repository
with <code>hg pull</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>pulling from ssh://hg@bitbucket.com/jasonwryan/dwm-patchset
</span><span class='line'>requesting all changes
</span><span class='line'>adding changesets
</span><span class='line'>adding manifests
</span><span class='line'>adding file changes
</span><span class='line'>added 6 changesets with 16 changes to 10 files
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">(</span>run <span class="s1">&#39;hg update&#39;</span> to get a working copy<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>After I update my local repo,<sup>1</sup> I can see the full patchset with
<code>hg qseries</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>setup.makefile
</span><span class='line'>base.config.customizations
</span><span class='line'>statuscolours
</span><span class='line'>cycle
</span><span class='line'>push
</span><span class='line'>bstack
</span><span class='line'>centurion.config
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>Then, as I decribed in my previous post, I make the changes to
<span class="file">config.def.h</span> that are specific to this
machine:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>hg qnew veles.config
</span><span class='line'> <span class="c"># “hack, hack, hack…”</span>
</span><span class='line'>hg qrefresh
</span><span class='line'>hg qcommit -m <span class="s1">&#39;Adaptions for Veles&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>My patchset now has an additional patch in it:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>┌─<span class="o">[</span>Veles ~/Build/dwm<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>└─╼ hg qseries
</span><span class='line'>setup.makefile
</span><span class='line'>base.config.customizations
</span><span class='line'>statuscolours
</span><span class='line'>cycle
</span><span class='line'>push
</span><span class='line'>bstack
</span><span class='line'>centurion.config
</span><span class='line'>veles.config
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>This is where guards come in to play. If I wasn&#8217;t interested in sharing
the patchset, it would just be a matter of deleting the patch for Centurion.
However, what I want to do is direct MQ to ignore that specific patch
when applying the queue. I do that by creating a negative guard and then
activating it:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>hg qguard centurion.config -- -block
</span><span class='line'>hg qselect block
</span><span class='line'>number of unguarded, unapplied patches has changed from 8 to 7
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>That&#8217;s it! Adding a verbose flag to <code>hg qseries</code><sup>2</sup> will print out the
patchset and the accompanying guard status:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>┌─<span class="o">[</span>Veles ~/Build/dwm<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>└─╼ hg qseries -v
</span><span class='line'>0 U setup.makefile
</span><span class='line'>1 U base.config.customizations
</span><span class='line'>2 U statuscolours
</span><span class='line'>3 U cycle
</span><span class='line'>4 U push
</span><span class='line'>5 U bstack
</span><span class='line'>6 G centurion.config
</span><span class='line'>7 U veles.config
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>The real test, of course, is pushing the patchset onto the fresh
dwm code:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>┌─<span class="o">[</span>Veles ~/Build/dwm<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>└─╼ hg qpush -a
</span><span class='line'>applying setup.makefile
</span><span class='line'>applying base.config.customizations
</span><span class='line'>applying statuscolours
</span><span class='line'>applying cycle
</span><span class='line'>applying push
</span><span class='line'>applying bstack
</span><span class='line'>skipping centurion.config - guarded by <span class="s1">&#39;-block&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>applying veles.config
</span><span class='line'>now at: veles.config
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>How cool is that? One central patchset, applied conditionally depending
upon the machine you are using at the time.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>Any guards applied on other machines will be present in the newly
pulled <span class="file">series</span> file: these conflicts will need
to be manually merged…</li>
<li>The options for all of the <code>hg</code> commands can be read with
<code>hg -v help $command</code>. For those related to queues, just prepend
a <code>q</code> to <code>$command</code>.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/queue.jpg" title="'Queue image on Flickr'" >
Over the last week or so, I have finally gotten around to digging into the whole concept of
using
<a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/managing-change-with-mercurial-queues.html" title="Chapter on queues in the Mercurial book">Mercurial Queues</a>
to manage patches against an upstream project; in my case
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org" title="The truly suckless window manager…">dwm</a>.<sup>1</sup>
Essentially, this mercurial extension helps you manage a stack of patches on
top of a directory tree. This gives you quite a lot of fine-grained control
over your patchset and assists immeasurably with automating the application of
patches when the underlying codebase changes.</p>

<p>After having played around with queues for the last couple of days, I am quite
impressed: both the concept and the execution are simple and powerful. The concept
of Mercurial Queues is best described in the Mercurial book: the aptly titled,
<em>Mercurial: The Definitive Guide</em>:<sup>2</sup></p>

<blockquote><p>MQ&#8217;s marriage of distributed revision control with patches makes it much easier to isolate your work. Your patches live on top of normal revision history, and you can make them disappear or reappear at will. If you don&#8217;t like a patch, you can drop it. If a patch isn&#8217;t quite as you want it to be, simply fix it—as many times as you need to, until you have refined it into the form you desire.</p><footer><strong>Mercurial, The Definitive Guide</strong> <cite><a href='http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/managing-change-with-mercurial-queues.html'>hgbook.red-bean.com/read/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I followed Filippo Negroni&#8217;s excellent
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/customisation/patch_queue" title="Step-by-step guide">tutorial on the dwm site</a>
to setup my own
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/dwm-patchset/src" title="Patchset in Bitbucket repo">dwm patchset</a>
based on
<a href="http://hg.suckless.org/dwm" title="dwm hg repository">tip</a>, and the process was
surprisingly straightforward; the only caveat being it is a good idea to plan
quite carefully what changes you want in each particular patch. Once I had
completed the setup, it got me thinking about the fact that the final install
is done without <code>pacman</code>, just using <code>make install</code>. And, as a proof-of-concept
more than anything else, I wondered whether this functionality could be used
with <code>makepkg</code>.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Turns out, as you might expect with Arch, it was not much of a job to set it
up at all.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: this doesn&#8217;t mean I think it is a good idea; I was just interested
to see <em>if</em> it could be done and <em>how</em> it would work once it was set up. For something
like dwm, this is definitely a case of introducing a huge amount of complexity for
no apparent benefit (for those people running Gnome, this may quite appeal to you…).</p>

<p>I have a
<a href="http://pikacode.com/jasonwryan/Centurion/file/default/Build/dwm-hg/PKGBUILD" title="If you must…">working PKGBUILD</a>
that you can use if you want to follow along at home. Once you have downloaded
it into <span class="file">dwm-hg/</span>, run <code>makepkg</code> to clone the dwm
repository and build the binary.  Then you need to make sure that the mercurial
queue extension is enabled, so your <span class="file">.hgrc</span> needs to
contain:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>extensions<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>hgext.mq <span class="o">=</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>Now, you need to setup the queue repository. We do this in <code>$srcdir</code>, which
is <span class="file">dwm-hg/src/dwm</span>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>hg qinit -c
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>The next step is to start applying the various patches that you want to comprise
your patchset on dwm. In my case that is base customizations to <span class="file">config.def.h</span>
and three other patches:
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/dwm-patchset/src/default/statuscolours" title="Patch in mercurial queue">statuscolours</a>,
<a href="http://https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/dwm-patchset/src/default/cycle" title="ditto">cycle</a>, and
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/dwm-patchset/src/default/push" title="etc…">push</a>.
There are other patches in my repository, one of which patches the appropriate
settings for an Arch build in the
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/dwm-patchset/src/default/setup.makefile" title="Arch settings for Makefiles">relevant makefiles</a>.
This is taken care of by the PKGBUILD in this case.</p>

<p>From here, it is very much as Filippo describes it in his tutorial: make
some changes, add them to the queue and rinse and repeat:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>hg qnew base.customizations
</span><span class='line'> <span class="c"># “hack hack hack…”</span>
</span><span class='line'>hg qrefresh
</span><span class='line'>hg qcommit -m <span class="s1">&#39;Added changes to config.def.h to customize&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>After committing each of your changes as a discrete patch, you can review the queue
with <code>hg qseries</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>┌─<span class="o">[</span>Centurion ~/Build/dwm-hg/src/dwm<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>└─╼ hg qseries
</span><span class='line'>config.customizations
</span><span class='line'>statuscolours
</span><span class='line'>cycle
</span><span class='line'>push
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>And <code>hg qapplied</code> will tell you which of the patches is currently
applied in the working repository; at this stage the list should look
the same as that in <code>hg qseries</code>. The next step is to remove all of the
patches from the queue so that we have a clean repository:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>┌─<span class="o">[</span>Centurion ~/Build/dwm-hg/src/dwm<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>└─╼ hg qpop -a
</span><span class='line'>popping push
</span><span class='line'>popping cycle
</span><span class='line'>popping statuscolours
</span><span class='line'>popping config.customizations
</span><span class='line'>patch queue now empty
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>Should you need to edit a patch, it is simply a matter of popping
to that spot in the stack (you can do so by name or by index
number, beginning at 0):</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>┌─<span class="o">[</span>Centurion ~/Build/dwm-hg/src/dwm<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>└─╼ hg qpop config.customizations
</span><span class='line'>popping push
</span><span class='line'>popping cycle
</span><span class='line'>popping statuscolours
</span><span class='line'>now at: config.customizations
</span><span class='line'> <span class="c"># “hack hack hack…”</span>
</span><span class='line'>hg qrefresh
</span><span class='line'>hg qpush -a
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>Once you are satisfied with the state of the stack, remove all of the
patches to return to the original clean working directory and <code>cd</code> back
to <span class="file">dwm-hg/</span>. You can now use <code>makepkg -fi</code> to
rebuild the package and you should see the pushed patches as part of
the output:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="o">==</span>&gt; Starting build<span class="o">()</span>...
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">==</span>&gt; Pushing queued patchset
</span><span class='line'>applying config.customizations
</span><span class='line'>applying statuscolours
</span><span class='line'>applying cycle
</span><span class='line'>applying push
</span><span class='line'>now at: push
</span><span class='line'>dwm build options:
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>…and when you restart dwm, your customizations will be applied.
When new changes are pushed to
<a href="http://hg.suckless.org/dwm" title="dwm mercurial repo">the dwm repo</a>
you can just <code>makepkg -fi</code>, and, if any of the patches fail due
to changes in the underlying code, pop the stack to the failed
patch, rebase the code, <code>hg qrefresh</code> and continue until done.</p>

<p>As I said at the beginning of this post, this isn&#8217;t a particularly smart way to
use Mercurial Queues, PKGBUILDs or a combination of the two. You are much
better off just cloning dwm to your local repository, initializing a queue
repository and, once you are done setting up your patchset, issuing <code>make &amp;&amp;
sudo make install</code>.</p>

<p>If you have more than one machine, you can easily setup a repository for
your patchset on
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/" title="bitbucket free mercurial hosting">bitbucket</a>
and host it there: then just pull the patchset queue
from your other boxes and <code>hg qpush -a</code>. If you require a slightly
different patchset for each box, you can use MQ to manage this
process as well. This is where MQ really excels;
I&#8217;ll cover this in more detail in my next post.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>See <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/categories/dwm/" title="dwm category in the archives">related dwm posts</a>.</li>
<li>I can&#8217;t recommend this {book,wiki} highly enough; it is an excellent
example of thorough, accessible documentation.</li>
<li>In the case of something like dwm, this is really irrelevant, as there
is a single tiny binary and a <code>man</code> page, so keeping track of these files on
your system is not an issue at all.</li>
