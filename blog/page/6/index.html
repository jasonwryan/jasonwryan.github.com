One of the most satisfying aspects of running free and open source software is
the ability to be able to continually tinker with your setup, limited only by
your imagination and ability.  The more you do tinker, the smaller the gap
between the former and the latter, as each small project inevitably leads you
into a deeper understanding of various aspects of your system<sup>1</sup> and
how you can customize that system to suit your exact requirements.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of days, I have been playing with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev" title="Wikipedia page">udev</a>, the kernel device
manager, as I was attempting to run a script once a specific
<acronym title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</acronym> drive was plugged in. It
turns out, as is so often the case, that udev is only <em>part</em> of the
picture…</p>

<p>As both my work and personal laptops have relatively small
<acronym title="Solid State Drives">SSDs</acronym>, I carry around
<a href="http://alpha.libre.fm/user/jasonwryan/" title="Libre.fm profile">my music</a>
on a 1TB external drive. As the drive only contains <span class="file">.flac</span>
files, I wanted to automate the process of <code>rsync</code>’ing music from my desktop to
the drive and, for the laptops, repopulating the symlinks to
<span class="file">~/Music/</span> when the drive was plugged in.</p>

<p>My first thought was a rule in <span class="file">/etc/udev/rules.d/</span>,
using <code>RUN+=</code>. There are any number of blog posts espousing this approach and,
as I quickly discovered, they are <em>all</em> wrong. The problem with using this key is
that, as the <code>man</code> page makes clear, it is not designed for long running
programs:</p>

<blockquote><p>This can only be used for very short-running foreground tasks. Running an event process for a long period of time may block all further events for this or a dependent device.</p><p>Starting daemons or other long running processes is not appropriate for udev; the forked processes, detached or not, will be unconditionally killed after the event handling has finished.</p><footer><strong>udev manual</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/udev.html'>www.freedesktop.org/software/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>The problem, as it manifest for me, was the drive would be blocked from
mounting until <em>after</em> the script had run, meaning <code>rsync</code> or my symlinks would
have no target.  There are various “workarounds” on the web for this, including
using <em>two</em> scripts, one to trigger the other<sup>2</sup>. Even for me, this
seemed like a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory" title="Wikipedia entry">Pyrrhic victory</a>.</p>

<p>The correct way to do this, as I found once I uncovered
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=149419" title="Arch BBS">this thread</a>
on the Arch boards where WonderWoofy and 65kid helpfully pieced it together, is
to use <code>SYSTEMD_WANTS</code>.  As it is described in the manual:</p>

<blockquote><p>THE UDEV DATABASE<br/>  The settings of device units may either be configured via unit files, or directly from the udev database (which is recommended). The following udev properties are understood by systemd:</p><p>  SYSTEMD_WANTS=<br/>  Adds dependencies of type Wants from this unit to all listed units. This may be used to activate arbitrary units, when a specific device becomes available. Note that this and the other tags are not taken into account unless the device is tagged with the &#8220;systemd&#8221; string in the udev database, because otherwise the device is not exposed as systemd unit.</p><footer><strong>man systemd.device</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.device.html'>www.freedesktop.org/software/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>So, I edited <span class="file">/etc/udev/rules.d/90-usb-music.rules</span> to
remove the <code>RUN+=</code> key, using a systemd service file instead, like so<sup>3</sup>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">SUBSYSTEMS</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="s2">&quot;usb&quot;</span>, ATTRS<span class="o">{</span>idProduct<span class="o">}==</span><span class="s2">&quot;1905&quot;</span>, <span class="nv">ACTION</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="s2">&quot;add&quot;</span>, ENV<span class="o">{</span>SYSTEMD_WANTS<span class="o">}==</span><span class="s2">&quot;upmusic.service&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>And then wrote the corresponding service file to have systemd hand off to the bash script:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>/usr/lib/systemd/system/upmusic.service </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>Unit<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">Description</span><span class="o">=</span>Update music links from Apollo
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">Requires</span><span class="o">=</span>media-Apollo.mount
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">After</span><span class="o">=</span>media-Apollo.mount
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>Service<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">ExecStart</span><span class="o">=</span>/home/jason/Scripts/upmusic
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>Install<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">WantedBy</span><span class="o">=</span>media-Apollo.mount
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>As I mentioned in my post on my
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/10/28/dismount/" title="Unmount USB drives…">simple unmounting script</a>,
I use a naming convention for all my USB drives. In this case, my music is stored on Apollo, and
it is auto-mounted with
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Udiskie" title="Arch wiki page">udiskie</a>. In the
service file, systemd uses a hyphen instead of a forward slash, so the correct
designation is <code>media-Apollo.mount</code>.</p>

<p>Then it is just a matter of enabling the service with <code>systemctl enable upmusic</code> and,
whenever Apollo is plugged in to either my desktop of laptop, the appropriate
script will run and either update the files on Apollo or the symlinks on one of the
laptops.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/ad_free.png" title="Flickr CC Image" >
The relentless commercialization of traditional holidays, not just the December
variety but all of them now, means that what was ostensibly an occasion for
celebrating your particular flavour of $deity, pagan ritual or just an
opportunity to reconnect with your wider family, has been co-opted to the
worship of the most pernicious of all cults, consumerism.</p>

<p>Concomitant with this is the increasing corporatisation of the Internet; the
deliberate and seemingly ineluctable effort by a relatively small number of
global interests to turn most of the Internet into something more like cable
television. As someone who has not lived with a television for decades
precisely because I don&#8217;t want to live in a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber" title="Wikipedia page">Skinner box</a>
that is solely designed to condition me to compliantly purchase more product,
I find this rankly offensive (in the sense of morally repugnant as well as a
coordinated and remorseless assault).</p>

<p>With the escalation of both the level and nauseating intensity of advertising
around the “holiday season” and the almost hysterical exhortations to purchase
more happiness, I decided that the one thing that I would be really thankful for
this Christmas was better ad blocking.</p>

<p>I had been using
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Privoxy" title="Arch wiki entry">Privoxy</a> and an
<acronym title="Arch User Repository">AUR</acronym> script,
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/blocklist-to-privoxy/?ID=63431" title="AUR page">blocklist-to-privoxy</a>
but I was still experiencing a lot of ads sneaking through (particularly local
ones) and some unintended side effects of using Privoxy for this job, so I
decide to give Jake VanderKolk&#8217;s
<a href="http://gaenserich.github.io/hostsblock/" title="Homepage for Hostsblock">Hostsblock</a>
a shot.</p>

<p>I went with the basic, entry level setup:
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kwakd/" title="AUR page">kwakd</a> for serving blank
<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> in place of ads and
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=58976" title="AUR package">hostsblock</a> to
write to my <span class="file">/etc/hosts</span>. I didn&#8217;t see the need for
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dnsmasq" title="Arch Wiki page">dnsmasq</a> and,
after a week or so or using it haven&#8217;t seen the need to revisit that decision.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, it is working brilliantly. Where once web pages were festooned
with garish advertisements promising me ripped abdominals, tropical holidays and the
lasting serenity that only Apple products can really truly deliver, I now have
<a href="/images/post_images/herald.png" title="Screenshot of the local rag…">glorious whitespace</a></p>

<p>There are a couple of other factors to consider with Hostsblock. There is a very
simple command line interface for managing black and white listing of websites,
and the various “content distribution networks” that infest most commercial
sites like fleas. You can easily allow advertisements on or from sites and
organizations that you want to support, while forever muting the inane drivel
from the likes of Failbook <em>et al</em>.</p>

<p>Installation and setup are very straightforward, with simple instructions on the
<a href="http://gaenserich.github.io/hostsblock/" title="Two or three steps, max…">Hostsblock site</a>.
There is also an active thread on the
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=139784" title="Arch forum thread">Arch boards</a>
where Jake and a couple of others are extremely helpful.</p>

<p>If you are feeling listless, run-down and lacking in energy, why not try
Hostsblock? It will make your web pages brighter, speed up your page loads,
protect your privacy and make you insanely popular. Try Hostsblock today!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/sync.png" title="Bittorrent logo" >
I have
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/03/16/sync/" title="Post on the Alpha release">written previously</a>
about
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/sync" title="Sync webpage">BitTorrent Sync</a>, the encrypted
file syncing application that uses the bittorrent protocol to sync your data
over your <acronym title="Local Area Network">LAN</acronym>, or over the Internet,
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_to_peer" title="Wikipedia page">P2P technology</a>.
I have been using it since early this year as a replacement for
dropbox.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>At the beginning of this month, BitTorrent unveiled the
<a href="http://blog.bittorrent.com/2013/11/05/bittorrent-sync-beta-api-now-available-to-developers/" title="Sync blog announcement">Beta API</a>
for developers (meaning you have to tell them what you plan to do in order to
be issued a key). After some equivocation, I signed up with the rather flimsy
excuse of “writing a shell wrapper for the command line” and found, to my
chagrin, a key in my inbox the next morning.</p>

<p>This proved to be something of an unwelcome arrival. In theory, I was excited
about having access to a tool to query the Sync application. One of the nodes is
on my
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/06/29/raspberry/" title="Post on setting up a torrent box">headless Raspberry Pi</a>
and the idea of being able to issue a command from my laptop to ascertain what
was going on in the Pi&#8217;s synced folders was (and is) a tremendously attractive
one.</p>

<p>However, now that I was in
possession of the key, I felt morally obliged to do something with it. The
problem with this realization was that I had no idea how to work with an
<acronym title="Application Program Interface">API</acronym>, let alone writing
a script to accomplish my purported goal.</p>

<p>After spending some time looking at
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/developers/api" title="Such as it is…">the documentation</a>,
and buoyed by the optimism of ignorance, I decided to make good on my promise.
My first attempt sort of worked, but was hampered as much by a serious
conceptual flaw as it was by poor implementation. I decided, in spite of any number
of Stack Overflow posts warning expressly not to do this, to use <code>awk</code> to parse
the <a href="http://www.json.org/" title="JSON homepage">JSON data</a><sup>2</sup>. This was what I would
euphemistically describe as a “learning opportunity.” The result is preserved
for posterity in my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/commits/16c9dee17f097e83fb325e303d867e6fda488992?at=default" title="Bit of a trainwreck, but you have to start somewhere…">bitbucket repo</a>
(for the completists)…</p>

<p>At this point, I was fortunate that Earnestly in #archlinux introduced me to
keenerd&#8217;s purpose built tool, <a href="http://kmkeen.com/jshon/" title="Kyle's site: visit it. Now.">Jshon</a>.
And by “introduced” I mean generously (and patiently) talked me through how it
worked and how I could use it with the Sync API to achieve what I was after.
After a while playing with it, there was the—inevitably belated—moment of
realization: this thing is genius! It allows you to intelligently
<em>interrogate</em> the data. Not blindly chopping at it with an increasingly complex
series of actions in <code>awk</code><sup>3</sup>; but quite directly traversing the structure and
extracting the desired elements.</p>

<p>Now I was <em>cooking</em>. Well, more to the point, I was flailing about in a smoke
filled kitchen convinced that the feeling of euphoria was inspiration—not imminent
asphyxiation. Once again, Earnestly&#8217;s patience and bash skills were put to good effect.
The resulting script,
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/tip/Scripts/btstat" title="In bitbucket">btstat</a>,
is undeniably a triumph of his good ideas over my own poor execution. In other
words, the fact that it works so well is testament to his ability, but any and
all faults are mine alone<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<p>And it does work. It only requires
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&amp;q=jshon" title="Arch package db">Jshon</a>
(which you will already have installed because you use
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/03/09/aurphan/" title="My post on this great utility">aurphan, right?</a>)
and a file with your synced folders and their respective secrets on each line<sup>5</sup>, like so:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>directory1 YourRe@llyTr1cky53cr3t
</span><span class='line'>directory2 H0p3fu11yY0uG3tTh31d3@
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>The functionality in the script is limited at this stage to just querying the
application; I wasn&#8217;t interested in pushing changes at this point. So you can
access the version of the currently installed Syncapp, upload and download
speeds, the size of synced folders and list all of their contents.</p>

<p>It is a beta release, so the odd bug is to be expected. Overall, though, the API is
a welcome addition to what is a great application. If you have an API key, add
it to your <span class="file">sync.conf</span>,
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/tip/Scripts/btstat" title="On bitbucket">grab the script</a>
and give it a whirl. Undoubtedly, over the coming weeks more polished versions
will emerge in “proper” languages, but for the time being this does exactly what
I need.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>Yes, I would much prefer to use an open source tool to accomplish the same
thing but I haven&#8217;t found anything comparable that is this good to date…</li>
<li>In what I imagine is a complete coincidence, the JSON logo is uncannily
similar to the initial (and much better, I thought) Sync logo, as seen on
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/03/16/sync/">my original post</a>.</li>
<li>This is not intended as a slight on <code>awk</code>; which I am undoubtedly
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/09/15/awking/">fond of</a>, but rather the
limits of my ability with that language.</li>
<li>I am also indebted to Scott (firecat53) for testing and providing helpful
feedback on the early versions of the script.</li>
<li>It is worth noting that in the <code>$json</code> variable, I pass <code>curl</code> the -<code>n</code> option,
which means it reads my credentials from <span class="file">$HOME/.netrc</span>.</li>
</ol>
