  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/spoons.jpg" title="Creative Commons image of spoons" >
It is now almost exactly two years since the <acronym title="Arch Installer Framework">AIF</acronym>
was <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/news/install-media-20120715-released/" title="Arch News item">put out to pasture</a>.
At the time, it caused a degree of consternation, inexplicably causing some to
believe that it presaged the demise of—if not Arch itself, then certainly the
community around it. And I think it would be fair to say that it was the signal
event that launched a number of spin-offs, the first of which from memory was
Archbang; soon followed by a number of others that promised “Arch Linux with an
easy installation,” or something to that effect…</p>

<p>Of course, if you look back at the Installation Guide immediately before the
move to the new scripts, for example the version that shipped with the last AIF
in
<a href="https://projects.archlinux.org/aif.git/tree/doc/official_installation_guide_en?id=4b075d9cd09b5a0912528bd94ae2a0d4eeb2d7f9" title="In the Git repository">October, 2011</a>, it is pretty evident that
the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide" title="Installation Guide">current approach</a>
is <em>a lot</em> simpler. Sure, there is no curses <acronym title="Graphic User
Interface">GUI</acronym> to step you through each part of the install but the
introduction of <code>pacstrap</code> and <code>arch-chroot</code> meant that you no longer need those
prompts.</p>

<p>There is also the added advantage that these scripts are useful outside the
installation process itself; they can be used for system maintenance and, in
the rare event that your recent bout of experimentation at 2am after a few
drinks doesn&#8217;t pan out the way you anticipated, repair.</p>

<p>One of the other responses to the new approach, however, has been the steady
proliferation of “helpful” install scripts. These are essentially bash scripts
that emulate the behaviour of the AIF and walk people through an automated
install of their system. Well, not really their system, more accurately <em>a</em>
system. So you run one of these scripts, answer a few prompts and then, when
you reboot, you have a brand spanking new Arch Linux install running KDE with
the full panoply of software and, in a few special cases, some customized dot
files to “enhance” your experience.</p>

<p>From a certain perspective, I can see how these things appeal. “I wonder if I
could script an entire install, from the partitioning right through to the
desktop environment?” That sounds like a fun project, right? Where it all comes
unstuck, unfortunately, is when the corollary thought appears that suggests
sharing it with the wider community would be a good idea. It is at this point
that a rigorous bout of self-examination about the outcomes that you are
seeking and your base motivations for this act of selflessness are called for.</p>

<p>Whatever those motivations are, whether driven by altruism or the naked desire
for fame and fortune that have—from time to time—alighted on these projects
when they appear on /r/archlinux and the adoring throngs bestow their favours
in equal measures of upvotes and bitcoin, they are grotesquely misplaced. No
good comes from these things, I tell you; none.</p>

<p>Why not? Because, in the guise of being helpful, you are effectively depriving
people of the single most important part of using Arch: building it themselves.
It&#8217;s like inviting someone to a restaurant for an amazing <em>haute cuisine</em> meal,
sitting them down across the table from you and then them watching as the
staff bring out a mouth-watering array of dishes, each of which you
ostentatiously savour before vomiting it all back into their mouth.</p>

<p>Now, I am sure there is a small minority (well, at least from my own
sheltered experience I imagine it is small) who would
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetophilia" title="Wikipedia: SFW">relish this scenario</a>,
but for most it would qualify as a pretty disappointing date.</p>

<p>Then, after the technicolour <em>table d&#8217;hôte</em>, there is the matter of the
clean up. Recently, we had someone show up on the
<a href="http://bbs.archlinux.org" title="Community forums">Arch boards</a> who had
“installed Arch” but who did not understand how to edit a text file;
literally had no clue how to open a file like <span class="file">/etc/fstab</span>
make some changes and then save it. This is beyond stupid; it is a drain
on the goodwill of the community that has to deal with this ineptitude, it
is unfair on people to put them in a position where they feel they are
at the mercy of their technology, rather than in control of it, and it
does nothing to advance the interests of Arch.</p>

<p>If you want to write something like this to improve your scripting skills,
by all means proceed. If you want to contribute to Arch, then pick a
project to contribute to, some bugs to squash, wiki edits, whatever; just
don&#8217;t publish another one of these idiotic scripts, because you aren&#8217;t
doing anyone any favours, quite the contrary.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/raspberry-pi-logo.png" title="Pi logo" >
After relieving my Pi of
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/06/29/raspberry/" title="Post on Torrent Pi">seedbox duties</a>,
I was looking around for some other use for it. I decided, after looking over
the Arch wiki article on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Openvpn" title="Simple, really…">OpenVPN</a>,
that the Pi would be a terrific <acronym title="virtual private network">VPN</acronym>
server; when I am out and about I can access a secure connection to my home
network, thereby significantly reducing the risk of my privacy being
compromised while using connectivity to the Internet provided by the
notoriously security conscious sysadmins that run networks in hotels and
other public places.</p>

<p>Setting it up was straightforward enough, the wiki is typically clear and thorough; the only
bottleneck in the process was waiting for the Pi&#8217;s tiny chip to chug through the creation of
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Create_a_Public_Key_Infrastructure_Using_the_easy-rsa_Scripts" title="Wiki page on the easy-rsa scripts">public keys</a>. Once it was done, and I had tested that it was
indeed working as intended, a more vexing issue presented itself. The service wouldn&#8217;t come
up after rebooting. Not a deal breaker, I could always just <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym>
in and manually bring the server up, but that sort of defeats the purpose of being able to
have the thing running reliably.</p>

<p>The reason that it fails on boot is that, without a hardware clock, the Pi
resets its time to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time" title="Wikipedia article">UNIX time</a>
until the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ntp" title="Arch wiki page">NTP</a> daemon can
start, which in turn depends upon the network being up. So, after rebooting,
the journal would show the VPN server as having failed as the date was nearly
half a century ago.</p>

<p>There are a variety of fixes floating around, the most amusing being
<a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=6037#p34228" title="Yes, really…">a wrapper for init</a>.
Suffice to say, this wasn&#8217;t an option for me. Looking at the problem logically, it occurred to me
that the issue was actually a trivial one: the correct sequencing of different services
post boot. Isn&#8217;t this, I asked myself, one of the issues
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/" title="At freedesktop.org">systemd</a> was supposed
to address?</p>

<p>I just had to ensure that the network came up as quickly as possible after boot, that the time
was reset correctly once there was a viable connection, and that the <code>openvpn.service</code> waited for
those things to happen before launching.</p>

<p>I have fitted the Pi with a wireless dongle, so the first step was to ditch
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Netctl" title="Arch wiki page">netctl</a> (the
default network manager on the ARM image) and replace it with
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-networkd" title="More wiki pages for you…">systemd-networkd</a>.
This is the point at which all the wingnuts that think that systemd is some
sort of conspiracy to overthrow the old UNIX gods and replace them with false
idols in <em>chapeau rouge</em> start foaming at their retrognathic mouths about
“viral takeovers” and—seriously what fucking planet do these imbeciles hail
from?—“an abhorrent and violent slap in the face to the Unix
philosophy.”<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>For those of us that accept the theory of evolution, this technology is both
effective and non-threatening; in fact, it is quite an improvement over its by
now ageing predecessor. So, a few minutes later,
<span class="file">/etc/systemd/network/wlan0.network</span> and
<span class="file">/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf</span> had pretty much
written themselves and then it was just a matter of enabling the eponymous services
as well as <code>systemd-resolved.service</code>. Reboot and the network is up seemingly
<em>instantly</em>.</p>

<p>Compounding my heresy, I then switched out NTP for
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-timesyncd.8.html" title="Man page">systemd-timesyncd</a>
and the Pi&#8217;s clock was now reset with the same alacrity. The final piece, ensuring
that the openvpn service waited for this to happen, was to add two lines to the
service file:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">After</span><span class="o">=</span>network-online.target
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">Wants</span><span class="o">=</span>network-online.target
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>That is all there is to it. Reboot and the network comes up, the clock is reset and then
the OpenVPN server starts. Like magic. The sort of heathen magic that threatens to
sap and impurify all of our
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKR32ImWYzw" title="it's like that…">precious bodily fluids</a>.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>No, Virginia, I did <a href="http://boycottsystemd.org/">not make that up</a>…
And I don&#8217;t really understand how you can slap a philosophy in the face, but then
rationality is anathema to zealots; irrespective of which chimæra they
prostrate before.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/vimbot.jpg" title="Practical Vim cover image" >
<a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="Vim homepage">Vim</a> is not just an editor (and not in the way that
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" title="GNU Emacs page">Emacs</a> is more than
<a href="http://en.uncyclopedia.co/wiki/Emacs" title="Uncyclopedia entry">just an editor</a>);
it is for all intents and purposes a universal design pattern. The concept of using
Vim&#8217;s modes and keybinds extends from
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2011/12/01/readline/" title="Post on readline">the shell</a>
through to <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2009/12/28/changing-keybinds-in-vifm/" title="Post on Vifm">file managers</a>
and <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/11/20/vimprobable/" title="Vimprobable screencast">browsers</a>.
If you so choose (and I <em>do</em>), then a significant amount of your interactions with your
operating system are mediated by Vim&#8217;s design principles. This is undeniably a
good thing™ as it goes some way to standardising your command interface (whether at the
command line or in a <acronym title="Graphic User Interface">GUI</acronym>).</p>

<p>To that end, I have been spending more time working with Vim and trying to
improve both my understanding of it&#8217;s capabilities, the environment in which I
use it and how I can optimise both of those conditions to not necessarily just
be more productive, but to minimise friction in my work flows.</p>

<p>A large part of my job involves writing and, happily, so does a good deal of
what constitutes my leisure activity. Whether it is emails written in
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/categories/mutt/" title="Mutt category">Mutt</a>, these blog posts,
longer documents written in <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" title="LaTeX website">LaTeX</a>,
or just <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2014/03/22/autotext/" title="Autotext function">roboposting to forums</a>;
it is Vim all the way down. So I have spent some effort setting up Vim to make
that experience as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p><a href="/images/post_images/distract-full.png"><img class="right" src="/images/post_images/distract.png" title="Click for full-size" ></a>
The first step, and one I took several years ago now, was to write custom
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/tip/.vim/colors/" title="In Bitbucket repo">colour schemes</a>,
depending on whether I am in the console or X. Several weeks ago, I came across a Vim plugin
called <a href="https://github.com/chrisbra/DistractFree" title="Github repo">DistractFree</a>, which
is described as “enabling a distraction free writing mode.” I had always been slightly
(well, perhaps <em>scathingly</em> would be more accurate) cynical when reading about these sorts
of things when they first started to appear, but—after playing with two or three of them—this
one has really grown on me (see the screenshot on the right).</p>

<p>I <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/tip/.vim/colors/mirowriter.vim" title="Bitbucket repo">adapted my colour scheme</a> for it, added a line to my <span class="file">~/.vimrc</span>
to enable it for specific document types, and have not looked back.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'>autocmd <span class="nb">BufRead</span> *.markdown<span class="p">,</span>*tex <span class="k">call</span> DistractFree#DistractFreeToggle<span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="k">wincmd</span> <span class="k">w</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>The final piece was to set up spell checking  to work properly. As well as
using English, I wanted to share my personal whitelist of words between all of
my machines, so I define a location in <span class="file">~/.vimrc</span>
as well:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">spelllang</span><span class="p">=</span>en_gb                               <span class="c">&quot; real English spelling</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">dictionary</span><span class="p">+=</span><span class="sr">/usr/</span>share<span class="sr">/dict/</span>words             <span class="c">&quot; use standard dictionary</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">spellfile</span><span class="p">=</span>$HOME<span class="sr">/Sync/</span><span class="k">vim</span><span class="sr">/spell/</span><span class="k">en</span>.utf<span class="m">-8</span>.add   <span class="c">&quot; my whitelist</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>Then it is just a matter of ensuring that misspelled or other flagged words (like those
that should be capitalised) are highlighted correctly. This required a couple of lines in
my colour schemes:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'><span class="c">&quot; Spell checking  --- </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="k">version</span> <span class="p">&gt;=</span> <span class="m">700</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">hi</span> clear SpellBad
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">hi</span> clear SpellCap
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">hi</span> clear SpellRare
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">hi</span> clear SpellLocal
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">hi</span> SpellBad    ctermfg<span class="p">=</span><span class="m">9</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">hi</span> SpellCap    ctermfg<span class="p">=</span><span class="m">3</span>    cterm<span class="p">=</span><span class="nb">underline</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">hi</span> SpellRare   ctermfg<span class="p">=</span><span class="m">13</span>   cterm<span class="p">=</span><span class="nb">underline</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">hi</span> SpellLocal  cterm<span class="p">=</span>None
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">endif</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>The most significant change, however, was that I recently purchased a hard
copy of Drew Neill&#8217;s excellent
<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim" title="Just buy it, now…">Practical Vim</a>. I
have long been a fan of Drew&#8217;s excellent podcast, <a href="http://vimcasts.org/" title="Drew's site">Vimcasts</a>,
and the book is every bit as impressive as the collection of those episodes,
and more.  Reading it on my commute over the last week, I have been constantly
amazed at the power and flexibility of this editor and Drew&#8217;s ability to clearly
articulate how to work economically and efficiently with it.  I&#8217;m convinced
this is an invaluable resource for anyone that currently uses Vim or wants to
learn.</p>

<p>I expect that, over time, as I become more proficient with Vim, that I will adapt
some of these settings, but for the time being they feel very comfortable and allow
me to focus on hacking words together (and to do the occasional bit of
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/tip/Scripts/" title="Scripts in Bitbucket">scripting on the side</a>)…</p>
