  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/notes.jpg" title="'Notepad image on Flickr'" >
Nearly two years ago, I posted about my adaption of a simple
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/09/28/command-line-notes/" title="My post in 2010">command line note utility</a>.
I have used this setup on all of my machines on a daily basis since and it has worked
marvellously. Symlinking to a folder in
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home" title="Dropbox home">Dropbox</a> means that the notes are accessible
from all my machines, including my phone. There has only really been one aspect of this setup
that has been sub-optimal.</p>

<p>As an inveterate note-taker (this is one of the “benefits” of ageing; the speed with
which you forget information outpaces the acquisition of newer material) I have—in
those intervening years—built up quite a store of notes. Consequently, in order to
maintain a semblance of order, I have arranged them in a series of directories. There
is a minor flaw with this approach: retreiving a note depended on two factors, a) excellent
recall<sup>1</sup> and, b) accurately typing out the full path. Neither of these are things that I
am inherently good at or inclined to master.</p>

<p>This had been irritating me for some time before I came across this
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/11906/how-to-change-the-target-directory-for-tab-completion" title="Tab completion for notes function">question on Unix &amp; Linux StackExchange</a>.
This provided me with a partial solution to the issue but, as I note in my answer, I was not
able to solve it for nested directories, which was my particular use case. Once I had
muddled my way through the solution on U&amp;L I pushed it to the back of my mind and
tried to ignore it.</p>

<p>Recently, though, the accumulation of notes and the frustration of trying to access them
without <kbd>Tab</kbd> completion drove me to do something about it.</p>

<p>The documentation on
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion-Builtins.html" title="Bash Manual">programmable completion</a>
is typically terse and searching the web returns very little in the way of instructions
as to how to accomplish this.<sup>2</sup> Undeterred, I decided to hack up a completion
function that worked for nested directories.</p>

<p>What I arrived at was this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">shopt</span> -s globstar

</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">complete</span> -o default -F _notes n
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>The best that can be said about it is that it <em>nearly</em> works…<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Realising that I was completely out of my depth, I turned to #bash for help, and
I was indeed fortunate that
<a href="https://github.com/geirha" title="geirha's Gitgub">geihra</a> offered some much needed
assistance. geirha&#8217;s solution is an elegant one:</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">complete</span> -o default -F _notes n
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>In addition to working exactly as I hoped, it had the benefit of introducing me
to a couple more bash concepts that I hadn&#8217;t encountered;
<a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Arrays" title="Bash Guide on Greg's Wiki">adding elements to an array</a>
with <code>+=()</code> being one. For posterity, the full script is:</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>The alternative to remembering the full path name is to list all of the notes before
each operation with the <code>nls</code> function; this is not ideal either…</li>
<li>Which means that it is either so straightforward that few have bothered to write up their
experiences (most likely), or so arcane that not many have bothered (how it
feels to me). However, there are a couple of pages that I referenced in addition
to the official documentation:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion-Builtins.html">Adam Backstrong&#8217;s post</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fahdshariff.blogspot.co.nz/2011/04/writing-your-own-bash-completion.html">Fahd Shariff&#8217;s post</a></li>
<li><a href="http://devmanual.gentoo.org/tasks-reference/completion/index.html">Gentoo Development Guide</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It fails, as geirha pointed out, because it breaks the filenames on whitespace.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/troll.jpg" title="'Troll on Flickr'" >
I posted recently about
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/08/04/systemd/" title="Some thoughts on moving across…">my experiences shifting to systemd</a>
and how I found it, for all three of my Arch machines, to be a relatively simple and
straightforward process which, in the intervening weeks, has borne out the views of
the developers and other members of the community who have been using it for a longer
period—it works, and works well. At the start of this week, Stéphane Gaudreault
announced on Arch-dev-public the intention to
<a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2012-August/023389.html" title="ML post seeking developer views">replace the original initscripts with systemd</a>.</p>

<p>The reaction by some to this announcement was, to me, quite disappointing. My view of
open source communities is that by participating you are entering into a social contract.
That contract is that, as you are reliant on the goodwill of the wider community it is
incumbent on you to ensure that your overall contribution—in whatever form—brings
more to the community than it takes away. At the very least, you can strive to ensure
that it is a value neutral exchange.</p>

<p>Sadly, for some of the trolls on the <acronym title="Mailing lists">MLs</acronym>, that
is patently not the case. I want to take a closer look at just one of those threads, for two
reasons. First, it is a textbook case of a particularly pernicious troll. And second, in
conjunction with some other factors, it had an especially damaging effect on the wider
community.</p>

<p>The thread in question is on Arch-general, the largest of the mailing lists. It has
the suitably alarmist title
<a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2012-August/029856.html" title="A trolling we will go…">Think twice before moving to systemd</a>.
The troll, who has had only minimal involvement with the Arch community up until this
unfortunate moment starts by framing his “concern”<sup>1</sup>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I just became aware that Arch Linux plans to switch to systemd, and this worries me for several reasons.</p></blockquote>


<p>Felipe is worried. Ergo, <em>we</em> should be worried. Why should we be worried? Because,
despite the fact that systemd has been discussed and used by Archers since the
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=96316" title="57 page thread on the Arch BBS">middle of 2010</a>,
it has just come to his attention and now, with the formidable powers of his intellect,
he has detected a disturbance in the force.</p>

<blockquote><p>I tried systemd a while ago in a brand new machine with Arch Linux and the boot was *much slower*. After some exchanges with Lennart Poettering and other people in Google+[1], it became clear I was on my own. Eventually I found the culprit: Fedora uses CONFIG_HZ_1000, and Arch Linux uses CONFIG_HZ_300. It became clear to me that systemd was not ready for prime time, it wasn&#8217;t thoroughly tested in a lot of machines, and if you have problems Lennart Poettering will blame you (PulseAudio sounds familiar?).</p></blockquote>


<p>The salient phrases here are “it became clear I was on my own” and the even more telling,
“it became clear to me that systemd was not ready for prime time.” Once I had managed to
wipe away the tears of gratitude that were coursing down my cheeks, I realized that Arch
finally had finally found what it had been missing for all these years: a saviour. We
were going to be OK after all.</p>

<p>Felipe has “found the culprit.” Despite the best efforts of the Arch developers, upstream,
the other distros that have been using it for considerably longer, and the experience of the
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1147676" title="Thread on systemd - one of many">Arch users reported on our boards</a>,
no-one had the heroic ability to see through to the heart of this conundrum and expose
systemd for the fraud that it is.</p>

<p>But our gratitude should be tempered with some shame for we, the Arch community, have let
Felipe down. We haven&#8217;t lived up to the standards he expects of us. As he gently admonishes us:
“I was expecting more from the Arch Linux community.” Yes, Felipe, and you were right to.
We let you down; can you forgive us?</p>

<p>The thread goes on to generate more than 50 replies. All of them wasted.
His trolling is not interested in facts, in reason or logic; his method of argumentation is
not rational, and he is not interested in working toward an understanding
of the truth; he just wants to be right. At whatever cost to the wider community. These posts,
and trolls in other fora
<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/4/12/434" title="LKML exchange with Linus Torvalds">like this one</a>,<sup>2</sup>
are really about gratifying Felipe&#8217;s own voracious appetite for self-aggrandisement. In reality,
of course, it is a stunning illustration of the
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" title="Wikipedia entry">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>.
It would be pathetic if it were a victimless pursuit; but it is not.</p>

<p>Further down in the thread we see the inevitable frustration of the developer who leads
this work for Arch,
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/developers/#tomegun" title="Tom's developer profile">Tom Gunderson</a>,
finally <a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2012-August/029933.html" title="Tom's reply quoting Linus">boil over</a>.
This precipitates another thread where Tom announces that he will
<a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2012-August/029960.html" title="Tom's mail to the list">no longer participate in this list</a>.
This is from the developer that has patiently and constructively engaged with Arch users on the
list around this issue for the past several months. On his own time.</p>

<p>That is the impact of trolls like Felipe. That is a direct effect of his selfishness on the
wider community. What has he brought to the community? Dissent, distraction and posturing.
What has he taken away? The ability for all of us to engage with one of the developers
of the software we all use. His presence on the list, and that of a few others,
has been nothing short of corrosive.</p>

<p>And as for the smoking gun, the config setting that no-one was smart enough to
discover? Denis A. Altoé Falqueto went to the trouble to build another kernel
and run a test and, contrary to Felipe who provided no such evidence,
<a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2012-August/030145.html" title="Denis' post">posted the results</a>.
You can guess the outcome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/leap.jpg" title="Leap image on Flickr" >
I posted a couple of weeks ago about the impact of some of the current
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/07/19/breakage/" title="Post on the glibc change">changes to Arch Linux</a>.
There seems to be quite a bit of it about, because in conjunction with the move from
<span class="file">/lib</span> to <span class="file">/usr/lib</span>—and motivated by the same
overarching shifts in the other distributions—the other major change making its way through
the Arch community is the move to
<a href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd" title="Project page">systemd</a>. This change, however, has
been more controversial because it marks a shift away from Arch&#8217;s central configuration
file, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rc.conf" title="Arch wiki entry on rc.conf">/etc/rc.conf</a>;
a move that has disconcerted a number of people.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to get into whether or not this move is consistent with
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way" title="Wiki entry">The Arch Way</a>, because that has
been thrashed over extensively on the
<a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2012-July/023283.html" title="ML thread on rc.conf">mailing</a>
<a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2012-July/023258.html" title="And another one…">lists</a>,
but also—and more importantly—because Arch is a rolling release, which means change is <em>inevitable</em>.
What is more, after watching all the back and forth on the <acronym title="Mailing lists">ML</acronym>
and on the <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=96316&amp;p=1" title="Arch BBS thread on systemd">boards</a>, I am convinced that the
<a href="http://www.archlinux.org/developers/#tomegun" title="Tom Gunderson">developer overseeing this shift</a>
both knows what he is doing and is acting in the best interests of Arch.</p>

<p>This view has been validated by my experience of shifting to systemd on my machines.</p>

<p>When the new initscripts package was pushed to [testing] in the middle of last month,
I stripped out all of the redundant options in <span class="file">/etc/rc.conf</span>
and took the ten minutes or so to read about and then create the new files. I then spent some
time reading up on systemd, principally
<a href="http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/systemd-for-admins-1.html" title="One of TWELVE…">Lennart Poettering&#8217;s series of posts</a>,
the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd" title="Good, but needing some structure">Arch wiki entry</a>
and the many and various
<a href="http://0pointer.de/public/systemd-man/" title="One for everything">manual pages</a>.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of days, I have migrated all of my machines over to systemd. I found it
to be a very straightforward process. I went for a pure systemd approach, for reasons I will
return to. Essentially, this is how I tackled it.</p>

<p>First, for each machine, I established what daemons were running. I did this by using
<a href="http://pikacode.com/jasonwryan/Veles/file/default/Scripts/daemons.sh" title="Pretty sure it is one of Xyne's">this shell script</a>
and cross checking entries in my <span class="file">/etc/rc.conf</span>. Then
it was just a matter of installing systemd:<sup>1</sup></p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>sudo pacman -S systemd systemd-sysvcompat systemd-arch-units
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>The only outstanding file to be created was <span class="file">/etc/timezone</span>, the
others—all documented in <code>man rc.conf</code>—I had created earlier in the month. Then, with the
list of the services I would need running on each box, I enabled them. I think it is
fair to say that the only thing that is clunky about systemd is the command syntax for
managing units. Repeatedly typing <code>systemctl enable foo.service</code> is as tedious as it is
error prone, so I hacked up a
<a href="http://pikacode.com/jasonwryan/Centurion/file/default/Scripts/sysd" title="sysd - *so* much easier">wrapper script</a>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>sysd <span class="nb">enable </span>acpid
</span><span class='line'>sysd <span class="nb">enable </span>lvm
</span><span class='line'>etc…
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>I also activated some additional gettys, as I like to log into a tmux session in TTY2 when
I don&#8217;t need or want to start <code>X</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>ln -sf /usr/lib/systemd/system/getty@.service /etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants/getty@tty2.service
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>And I misguidedly wrote a couple of custom service files that turned out to be
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=146207" title="BBS post on said files">completely unnecessary</a>;
and then I was done.</p>

<p>On all three boxes I rebooted and that was it. The only issue I experienced was
the final shutdown after removing initscripts and before booting up with
systemd. After issuing <code>shutdown -r now</code> the process
hung with a message about a missing <span class="file">inittab</span> file.
In retrospect, I should have added <code>init=/bin/systemd</code> to my kernel parameters
and not unistalled instiscripts until I had booted with systemd. This has
now been added to the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd" title="Archwiki systemd page">systemd wiki page</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, though: no real drama, just a blur of text<sup>2</sup> and then the
login prompt. While I haven&#8217;t seen a dramatic decrease in boot time,
booting does <em>feel</em> a bit snappier and two of my three machines shutdown
markedly more quickly. Consider me sold.</p>

<p>That brings me back to the decision to opt for a pure systemd approach, rather than
hanging on to a completely eviscerated <span class="file">/etc/rc.conf</span>. The
Arch community has been told that the intention is to
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1133957#p1133957" title="BBS post by tomegun">support the rc.conf format forever</a>;
I can&#8217;t help but think this is a mistake. In the same way that
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported" title="Pacman entry on Arch Wiki">partial upgrades are unsupported</a>,
I think that systemd is Arch&#8217;s inevitable future and the community should be encouraged to accept that, <code>Syu</code> and
move on…</p>

<p>Having said that, I appreciate the consideration shown by the developers in wanting to assure
people that their choice would continue to be catered for; and perhaps, over time, people still
using initscripts will be regarded with the same sense of wry amusement as those who still show
up from time to time with <code>hal</code> in their <code>DAEMONS</code> line.</p>

<h3>Update 4/8/12</h3>

<p>Tom Gunderson, the developer who looks after this part of Arch, has clarified the
comment about the long term support for initscripts. As comments are hosted on
a third-party paltform, I thought that it should be included in the body of the
post.</p>

<blockquote><p>Just a clarification: regarding the (probably very unwise) promise of &#8220;supporting <span="file">rc.conf</span> forever&#8221;, the intended meaning was that initscripts will support the syntax, not that initscripts themselves will always stay around (nor that systemd will gain support for the syntax in case initscripts is dropped).</p><p>At the moment systemd <strong>does</strong> support <span class="file">rc.conf</span> (when installed in conjunction with initscripts), but this is meant as a transitional measure only, and will likely go away eventually (though probably not soon).</p></blockquote>


<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>Note this approach will <em>remove</em> sysvinit and initscripts and <code>mv /etc/rc.conf{,.pacsave}</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure you remove <code>quiet</code> from your kernel parameters for your first systemd
boot so you can see that everything starts correctly…</li>
</ol>
