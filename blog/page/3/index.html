  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/ubuntu-logo.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I have been experiencing problems with my wifi LAN when playing music
through
<a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki" title="Music Player Daemon homepage">mpd</a>
or watching movies. My upload speeds would climb to around 120-130Kb/s
and my wifi would just go down.</p>

<p>Apart from being frustrating, this was inconvenient as it meant that if
I was doing either of those things, my stereo in the living room
couldn’t stream music from my
<a href="http://www.mysqueezebox.com/index/Home" title="Squeezebox home">squeezebox server</a>, or
other members of the family (or guests) couldn’t connect to the access
point to get online.</p>

<p>After asking on
<a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/45772/playing-music-or-movies-kills-my-wifi" title="My question on Ask Ubuntu">Ask Ubuntu</a>
(which, like many of the Ubuntu-related fora is populated with people
who are more well-intentioned than they are knowledgeable - which seems
to me one of the fundamental problems the distro has; but I’ll save that
rant for another day), one helpful user suggested I use
<a href="http://www.wireshark.org/" title="Wireshark website">wireshark</a> to diagnose
the network traffic.</p>

<p>I <em>really</em> should have thought of that myself. Nonetheless, it was
immediately instructive. Wireshark quickly identified that, as soon as I
started mpd, one of my ports was being flooded: 46560</p>

<p><code>lsof</code> showed that pulse audio was the culprit:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>pulseaudi 2190 jason 39u IPv4 14110 0t0 UDP mybox:56751-&gt;224.0.0.56:46560
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Quelle surprise… When software engineers want a case study of opacity
and abstraction from the user, this should be their first port of call.</p>

<p>Worse, it is a known bug.
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/411688" title="Pulse bug on launchpad">First logged in August, 2009</a>.
And apparently insufficiently serious to warrant any attention. Fair
enough, I suppose, given the fix is easy enough <em>if you know what you
are trying to fix…</em></p>

<p>Install the Pulse audio preferences tool:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install papref
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>…and disable Multicast/RTP.</p>

<p>Another example for me of Ubuntu’s fast waning utility as a distribution
for people that want to be able to exercize some control over their
system. It is only still installed on this machine because there isn’t
an official <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mirrors" title="Arch wiki mirror list">Arch Linux mirror</a>
here and, with my international traffic capped to 30Kb/s until last
month, I wasn’t prepared to try and run a distro on that sort of
bandwidth. Now that has changed, I suspect that Ubuntu’s days are
numbered on this box.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/quora1.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I joined <a href="http://www.quora.com/" title="Quora: Q&amp;A site">Quora</a> early in the
new year and, while
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/23/why-i-don%E2%80%99t-buy-the-quora-hype/" title="TC article on the hype">the hype has in no way abated</a>,
I have found that increasingly over the months that I have been
visiting, there is less and less reason for me to return on any regular
basis. And this puzzles me as I think the concept is, for me, an
attractive one.</p>

<p>In the five-odd months I have been visiting the site, I have managed to
<a href="http://www.quora.com/Jason-Ryan" title="My Quora profile">contribute 58 answers</a>
and over one hundred edits (more on that below); this strikes me as a reasonable
commitment on my part and one that should return some dividend to me –
at least in terms of satisfaction with the site. Alas, no.</p>

<p>And why not? For several reasons. And reasons that have only really
become apparent over the last month as I started to spend time on the
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/" title="Unix and Linux Stack Exchange">Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange site</a>.
The contrast between the <em>experience</em> of the two sites, that are in
essence very similar, couldn’t be more striking.</p>

<p>The primary difference between the two is that Unix.SE isn’t a social
site: you don’t follow anyone. Which, when you think about Q&amp;A sites,
makes a lot more sense than Quora’s model. I still don’t understand the
point of following people on Quora. Perhaps I am not following enough
people, or the wrong ones, but I have yet to see <em>any benefit</em> in
following on the site.</p>

<p>One other area of seeming similarity between the sites is the ability to
vote up (or down) questions and answers. On Unix.SE, this is implemented
as a real strength as these votes determine contributor’s reputation,
described thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>Reputation is a rough measurement of how much the community trusts
you. Reputation is never given, it is earned by convincing fellow
users that you know what you’re talking about.</p></blockquote>

<p>This has a twofold effect: it motivates contributors to provide quality
answers (and
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/badges" title="StackExchange badges">rewards</a>
them when they do), and more importantly, gives you a heuristic for how
credible an answer may be. Quora doesn’t have this concept and, for me,
is much the poorer for it.</p>

<p>Reputation has consequences on Unix.SE: the more you accrue, the more
privileges on the site you are granted. Again, this builds the
community’s capability while encouraging individual contributors.</p>

<p>Some of the other areas where Quora is really left wanting in comparison
to Unix.SE are around the design of the site. The text box where you
enter your answers or edits is a case in point:</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/quora2.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>On Quora, it is like trying to change a car battery through a letterbox.
The single, overriding impression is that entering information into the
site is neither a priority nor pleasurable which, for a site aspiring to
be a knowledge repository is incredibly perverse.</p>

<p>This is compounded by the fact that the tools for presenting the
information that you want to add to the site can charitably be described
as rudimentary (one of the reasons that I have 100-odd edits is that it
takes at least two to three attempts to present information in a
semi-acceptable fashion). Searching for
“<a href="http://www.quora.com/Quora-product/Are-there-any-markup-tags-when-writing-a-question?q=quora+markup+tools" title="Recursion alert">quora markup tools</a>”
is as disappointing as it is frustrating.</p>

<p>Being able to present information appropriately is critical. The
StackExchange sites
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/editing-help" title="Unix.SE editing guidleines">allow all sorts</a>
of HTML tags and
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" title="markdown syntax">markdown</a>,
without apparently any additional
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" title="Wikipedia page on Cross site scripting">XSS risk</a><sup>1</sup>.
The result is questions and answers that are formatted in a way that
enhances their legibility, rather than detracting from it.</p>

<p>There are some other areas where Quora is not measuring up for me:
opaque editorial and moderation policies and practices and an
unwillingness to more actively curate the questions – and no, those two
statements are not contradictory.</p>

<p>The overall impression I am left with is that while both sites have
similar aims (albeit Unix.SE’s is much more specific in terms of the
subject matter), Quora seems to me to be really failing at building a
community around it. Unless, of course, you count social media experts…</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>

<ol>
<li>God knows if that is actually the reason they refuse to allow
potential contributors the ability to adequately format their
information, but it seems plausible enough.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have been a solid user of
<a href="http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/" title="TTYtter homepage">TTYtter</a>
for a couple of years now, much preferring the speed and power of a
command line Twitter client. And, after having tried–at one time or
another–most of the Linux or cross-platform Twitter clients, I can
safely say that for me TTYtter is easily the best.</p>

<p>There is, however, a new
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/" title="ncurses page">ncurses</a> client
that is showing a lot of promise:
<a href="http://tyrs.nicosphere.net/index.html" title="Tyrs homepage">Tyrs</a>. Only at
the 0.2.1.1 stage, and with a fraction of the functionality that TTYtter
has, it is nevertheless a very nice client.</p>

<p>Requiring little in the way of dependencies, only python-twitter and
python-oauth2, both available in the
<a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/" title="Arch Linux User Repository">AUR</a> or in the
debian/Ubuntu repos (if you are using debian/Ubuntu, you will need the
newer python-twitter-0.8.2 for it to run).</p>

<p>Tyrs is easy to configure, with good documentation and a simple
configuration file, located by default at
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tyrs/tyrs.cfg. The default keybinds are
<a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="THE editor">Vim-centric</a>, naturally…</p>

<p>My config is pretty straightforward at this point:</p>

<p>Written in Python, the code is well commented and relatively easy to
find your way around if your are keen on hacking.</p>

<p>The developer, Nicolas Paris, is both approachable and helpful and is
actively developing Tyrs. With some more functionality in the pipeline,
it looks to be a very nice application.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/w3m.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I posted a couple of weeks ago about
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2011/04/13/archwiki-elvis-for-surfraw/" title="My post on the Arch Wiki elvis">how much I was enjoying Surfraw</a>,
to the point of writing a couple of my own <em>elvi</em>. As part of the
ongoing tweaking of my Surfraw experience, I have been experimenting
with different
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_web_browser" title="Wikipedia entry: text browsers">text-based browsers</a>,
to see which one best fits my workflow.</p>

<p>I have previously been using both
<a href="http://www.jikos.cz/~mikulas/links/" title="Links homepage (Spartan enough for you?)">links</a>
and it’s homonym,
<a href="http://lynx.browser.org/" title="See you, and raise you...">lynx</a>. While
these have been perfectly acceptable, they weren’t quite providing the
level of functionality —and integration with my vim-oriented workflow—
that I was looking for. Enter
<a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/" title="Lavish, by comparison...">w3m</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>w3m is a text-based web browser as well as a pager like `more’ or
`less’. With w3m you can browse web pages through a terminal emulator
window (xterm, rxvt or something like that). Moreover, w3m can be used
as a text formatting tool which typesets HTML into plain text.</p></blockquote>

<p>w3m is a step up from the other two for a variety of reasons. It
supports tables, frames, SSL connections, color and inline images. It
also renders pages in a form as true to their original layout as
possible. The killer features on top of that are, for me, the above
mentioned rendering of HTML as text (meaning you can save content
easily), and the customizable keybinds.</p>

<p>There was however, one significant sticking point. After countless hours
fruitlessly searching, I was unable to find a way to yank URLs to the
clipboard. As I have been spending a little time of late on
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/" title="Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange">Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</a>,
I thought I would ask the good folk there…</p>

<p>Less than fourty hours later, I had an answer so simple and elegant,
that I was literally grinning when I read it. It deserves quoting in
full. It is that ingenious.</p>

<blockquote><p>Set the “External Browser” option to
<code>sh -c 'echo "$0" | xsel'</code></p>

<p>You can use xsel -b to use the clipboard instead of the primary
selection. An alternative to
<a href="http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/" title="xsel homepage">xsel</a>
is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/" title="xclip homepage">xclip</a>
(xclip for the primary selection, xclip -selection CLIPBOARD for the
clipboard).</p>

<p>In <span class="file">~/.w3m/config</span>, that’s the extbrowser setting.
Then press M to copy (yank) the URL of the current page, or ESCM to
copy the URL of the link under the cursor.</p>

<p>You can use the second or third external browser for that instead;
then the key combination is 2M or 3M or 2ESCM or 3ESCM.
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12497/yanking-urls-in-w3m/12572#12572" title="THE answer">Gilles on Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This simple hack means that it is now trivial to yank either the URL of
the current page, or of the link under the cursor to primary selection.
It was just a matter then of adding some intuitive keybinds – as the <kbd>M</kbd>
and <kbd>Escape</kbd><kbd>M</kbd> combination are redolent of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war" title="Emacs vs Vi">the unamed editor</a>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">keymap</span> Y EXTERN_LINK
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The perfect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" title="The UNIX philosophy on Wikipedia">UNIX solution</a>…</p>

<h4>Updated 8/5/11</h4>

<p>Gilles has edited and updated his answer with a slight change:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>sh -c <span class="s1">&#39;printf %s &quot;$0&quot; | xsel&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This prevents a new line being appended.</p>

<p>I have been using
<a href="http://surfraw.alioth.debian.org/" title="Surfraw manifesto">Surfraw</a> for the
better part of eighteen months, and I think that it is a perfect Unix
tool: it does <em>one</em> thing, extremely well… If you haven’t come across
it, Surfraw is a command-line interface to a couple of dozen
repositories of knowledge. It is described thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>It reclaims google, altavista, babelfish, dejanews, freshmeat,
research index, slashdot and many others from the false-prophet,
pox-infested heathen lands of html-forms, placing these wonders where
they belong, deep in unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the
shell.<sup>1</sup></p></blockquote>

<p>The shell scripts that power the searches of the repositories are called
<em>elvi</em>, the singular being <em>elvis</em>. Currently, in
<a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=surfraw/surfraw.git;a=summary" title="Debian Git Repo: Surfraw">the git repo</a>,
there are
<a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=surfraw/surfraw.git;a=tree;f=elvi;hb=HEAD" title="elvi in the git repo">over 100 elvi</a>,
ranging from Wikipedia through to the CIA website (yes, the project was
founded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange" title="Julian's Wikipedia page">Julian Assange</a>),
Slashdot and The Wayback Machine.</p>

<p>As comprehensive as the list of elvi is, there was one glaring hole.
Arch Linux is represented in terms of elvi to search the
<a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/" title="Arch User Repository">AUR</a> and the
<a href="http://www.archlinux.org/packages/" title="Arch Package Database">official package repositories</a>,
but nothing for the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_Page" title="Definitive Arch Linux documentation">Arch Wiki</a>,
perhaps the best GNU/Linux reference wiki on the web.</p>

<p>So I thought I would rectify that.</p>

<p>You can grab the archwiki elvis from my

copy it into your local directory at <span class="file">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/surfraw/elvi/</span> or
in the system folder at <span class="file">$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/surfraw/</span> and you can surf the
Arch Wiki, or any one of the nine other language wikis, from the command
line.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/vim-colours1.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I have spent the last couple of days trying to understand why I couldn’t
get <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="Vim: the _only_ editor">Vim</a> to display the
correct 16 colours in the console. Not in a terminal emulator in X, like
<a href="http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html" title="XTerm homepage">xterm</a>
or
<a href="http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html" title="Homepage for urxvt">rxvt-unicode</a>,
but in the consoles, TTY1-6.</p>

<p>After a lot of searching, more reading into the
<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-16.html" title="The Linux terminal...">arcane documentation</a>
of Linux terminals than I was either prepared for or keen on and some
experimentation, I have it working. With one caveat; I wasn’t prepared
to set the <code>TERM</code> environment in my <span class="file">.vimrc</span>. Apart from being
<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-10.html#ss10.5" title="Console documentation">cautioned against</a>,
as I <em>do</em> set it for tmux, I was anxious to avoid any clashes when
running Vim in <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/" title="tmux homepage">tmux</a>
(which I do most of the time).</p>

<p>From the top, then. Logging into a console and checking the <code>$TERM</code> and
colours, gave me the default:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$TERM</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> tput colors
</span><span class='line'>linux
</span><span class='line'>8
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Which, under my current configuration of Vim, rendered colours like so:</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/vim-colours2.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Hardly satisfactory.</p>

<p>The first step was to remove the line in my <span class="file">.vimrc</span> that was forcing 256
colours:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">t_Co</span><span class="o">=</span>256
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then I had to rewrite my colourscheme to change all of the references to
the terminal colour numbers to colour <em>names</em>, as apparently that is
what 8-colour terms accept. So, my <span class="file">miromiro.vim</span>, went from looking like:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'><span class="k">hi</span> Normal          ctermfg<span class="p">=</span><span class="m">15</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">hi</span> Ignore          ctermfg<span class="p">=</span><span class="m">8</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">hi</span> Comment         ctermfg<span class="p">=</span><span class="m">7</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">hi</span> LineNr          ctermfg<span class="p">=</span><span class="m">8</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>…to the more literal:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'><span class="k">hi</span> Normal         ctermfg<span class="p">=</span>white    cterm<span class="p">=</span><span class="nb">bold</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">hi</span> Ignore         ctermfg<span class="p">=</span>black    cterm<span class="p">=</span><span class="nb">bold</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">hi</span> Comment        ctermfg<span class="p">=</span>grey
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">hi</span> LineNr         ctermfg<span class="p">=</span>black    cterm<span class="p">=</span><span class="nb">bold</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once I had made the necessary changes, I saved this new colourscheme as
<span class="file">miro8.vim</span><sup>1</sup>. And, yes, I know I could
have included it in an <code>if</code> condition in my original colourscheme<sup>2</sup>,
but I was intent on keeping things compartmentalized until I had it working…</p>

<p>Running Vim in the console was now starting to look promising:</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/vim-colours3.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The final piece of the puzzle was to pass my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/241da582a0fd/.colours/dark" title="jwr dark colours: mercurial repo">X colours</a>
to the console. Fortunately,
<a href="http://phraktured.net/linux-console-colors.html" title="The Overlord himself…">Aaron Griffin’s 2006 post</a>
made this a trivial exercise. With the following lines in my <span class="file">.bashrc</span>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then it was just a case of setting the relevant colourscheme in my
<span class="file">.vimrc</span>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> &amp;<span class="nb">t_Co</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span> <span class="m">256</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonwryan/5379701719/#/photos/jasonwryan/5379701719/lightbox/" title="Arch Linux: dwm with statuscolors patch"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/dwm-urgent.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>After nearly 12 months of running a pretty stable
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org" title="dwm homepage">dwm</a>, with a consistent
patchset (cycle,
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/push" title="Push on suckless wiki">push</a>,
and init pertag<sup>1</sup>) I finally added another one:
statuscolours<sup>2</sup>…</p>

<p>I have been experimenting with
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/12/26/wmfs-window-manager-from-scratch/" title="My post on using WMFS">WMFS</a>,
which is another very nice, minimal tiling window manager and was really
enjoying the urgency hints in the status bar, so I decided to patch that
functionality into dwm.</p>

<p>Most terminal applications will send a bell when your attention is
required; in my case, I was looking for a way to trigger notifications
for new mail in
<a href="http://www.mutt.org/" title="If you are using another mail user agent, you are doing it wrong...">mutt</a>
or highlights in <a href="http://irssi.org/" title="IRC client">irssi</a>. In mutt, it
was just a case of setting a bell for when mail arrived:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span>beep_new             <span class="c"># bell on new mail</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And in irssi:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">beep_msg_level</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;NOTICE MSGS HILIGHT&quot;</span>;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/" title="terminal mulitplexer">tmux</a>, to cover
all your terminal bases, add:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">set</span> -g bell-action any <span class="c"># listen for activity on all windows</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The next step is to pass those beeps to your terminal. The entry for
Urxvt is one I picked up after a quick search turned up
<a href="http://rsontech.net/articles/2008/11/17/1/handling-urgency-hints" title="Post on reson.tech">this post by rson</a>
which had the .Xdefaults line I was looking for:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>URxvt*urgentOnBell: <span class="nb">true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, whenever a bell is triggered in irssi or mutt, that is passed to
the terminal as an urgent hint. The final step was patching statuscolors
into dwm.c to change the tag colour when the hint was received.</p>

<p>You can see my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/workstation/src/82e7f34ee0a3/dwm-5.8.2-2/5.8.2-2.diff" title="dwm.c patched">patched dwm.c</a>
in my mercurial repo.</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>

<ol>
<li>These patches are from the extremely helpful Arch Forum thread:
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=92895" title="Thread on Arch boards for dwm hackers">DWM Hackers Unite!</a></li>
<li>I used a <a href="http://lists.suckless.org/dev/1011/6445.html" title="Dan Brown's patch">modified statuscolours patch</a>
from the suckless mailing list. It irons out the padding issues in the one on the wiki.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/intuxication.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I have previously posted about using
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/02/10/using-mercurial-to-share-dotfiles/" title="My post on using mercurial">Mercurial to share dotfiles</a>,
and how I have been using
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/" title="bitbucket homepage">bitbucket</a> as a free host
for that service.</p>

<p>Recently, I came across
<a href="http://beta.intuxication.org/" title="Free mercurial hosting">Intuxication</a>,
who describe themselves thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>Intuxication provides a free, fast and lightweight platform to host
your Mercurial repositories.</p></blockquote>

<p>You will see from their URL that they are only in beta, but the service—while
undeniably rough around the edges—looks quite promising.</p>

<p>For small projects, the limit is 1GB disk space, Intuxication provides
all of the basic features you need to maintain a mercurial repository.</p>

<p>One of the advantages it has over bitbucket is that the default
stylesheet makes it much easier to read the files that you host. And
while there are obviously plans to introduce more styles (from the
Configure menu you can select a dropdown of five different styles),
currently only one works.</p>

<p>If I had any criticism at all, it would be that the unfinished nature of
the website (like the broken styles and the fact that quite a few of the
other features like that don’t work) means that it feels a lot more like
an alpha than a beta.</p>

<p>However, I’m sure that with time and some support (there is a donate
button on every page), Intuxication will continue to develop. I think it
is a site with potential, and I’m currently pushing my
<a href="http://beta.intuxication.org/jasonwryan/archer/browse/tip/" title="EeePC tip">EeePC dotfiles</a>
there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/mailcheck.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.mutt.org/" title="Mutt homepage">mutt</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/wiki" title="Offlineimap on github">offlineimap</a>
to manage email on my Arch Linux machines. I like the simplicity and the
power that this approach offers; that’s power in the sense of
extensibility and customization, by the way…</p>

<p>Using <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/" title="dwm homepage">dwm</a> as my window
manager, I had relied on
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2009/11/21/dzen2-and-conky-cli-in-dwm/" title="My post on setting this up">conky and dzen2</a>
to pipe system information into my status bar. Unfortunately, conky only
supports one mail spool so if, like me, you use offlineimap to
synchronize multiple mailboxes, conky would only show new mail in your
primary box. I had asked in #conky about multiple mail spools, but it
doesn’t seem to be supported.</p>

<p>When I recently started using
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/12/26/wmfs-window-manager-from-scratch/" title="My post on Window Manager From Scratch">WMFS</a>
I decided to move to a
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/241da582a0fd/Scripts/wmfs-status" title="Script in mercurial repo">bash script for my status information</a>.
So I approached the problem afresh and decided to write a script to poll
the new mail directories and update my status bar when mail arrived.</p>

<p>Offlineimap creates a directory structure like so:</p>

<pre><code>   Mail/ -------
      |         |
      |     Mail_Account_1
      |         |
      |         | --  INBOX 
      |         |       | -- cur
      |         |       | -- new
      |         |       | -- temp
      |         |
      |         | -- INBOX.Drafts
      |         |       | -- cur
</code></pre>

<p>As I was only interested in checking the <span class="file">INBOX/new</span>
directory of each account, I had imagined that it would be necessary to set up some
elaborate array to effectively check each of the requisite sub-directories…</p>

<p>No, it was pretty simple. Just
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/abs/HTML/globbingref.html" title="ABS entry on globing">globbing</a>
and
<a href="http://linuxmanpages.com/man1/find.1.php" title="man page for find">find</a>,
actually.</p>

<p>The glob (<code>*</code>) takes care of the different mail account names, and has
the added bonus of being portable, and find returns any files (<code>-type f</code>)
with <code>wc</code> counting the number of lines (the <code>-l</code> switch).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonwryan/5289976238/lightbox/" title="Screenshot on Flickr"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/wmfs.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>I have been experimenting with a couple of new window managers over the
last week or so. Not that I am in any way dissatisfied with
<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/" title="suckless page for dwm">dwm</a> — far from it; I
do from time to time, however, like to see what else is on offer.</p>

<p><a href="http://wmfs.info/projects/wmfs" title="WMFS homepage">WMFS</a> is a fairly new
entrant in the window manager marketplace. The developers describe it
as:</p>

<blockquote><p>a lightweight and highly configurable tiling window manager for X… It
supports Xft (Freetype) fonts and is compliant with the Extended
Window Manager Hints (EWMH) specifications, Xinerama and Xrandr.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=26924" title="AUR page">git version is available</a> in
AUR, and is straightforward to build and install. The fun, as always,
comes with customization…</p>

<p>As is says on the box, WMFS is highly configurable. The configuration is
all done (initially) in one file, which you will need to copy to your
<span class="file">~/.config/wmfs/directory</span>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>cp /etc/xdg/wmfs/wmfsrc ~/.config/wmfs/
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Even the default config is relatively fully featured. There are nine
default layouts (about five more than I usually need, but it is always
better to over cater). The <span class="file">wmfsrc</span> is quite well
commented, so most of the options are self explanatory.</p>

<p>One thing I did note about editing this file, which is probably more a
reflection of my haste rather than the wm itself, is that it seemed
<em>very</em> unforgiving of any errors. More than once I had to copy the
default wmfsrc back across and start again. My advice is to make any
changes cumulatively, and test by reloading before continuing.</p>

<p>You can see my config file in my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/36ae3d14507b/.config/wmfs/wmfsrc" title="Mercurial repository for EeePC">bitbucket repo</a>.
Most of the changes have been made in setting up my preferred tags and
keybindings – so they are consistent with my dwm and
<a href="http://plhk.ru/" title="Echinus window manager home">echinus</a> setups.</p>

<p>One of the great features of WMFS is the status bar. You can pipe all
sorts of information into it with a bash script, and you can use colours
and icons (if that is your thing). Simply sourcing the bash script from
within wmfsrc will see it up and running:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">background_command</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$HOME/.config/wmfs/autostart.sh&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or, if you prefer to use conky:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>conky | <span class="k">while </span><span class="nb">read</span> -r; <span class="k">do </span>wmfs -s -name <span class="s2">&quot;$REPLY&quot;</span>; <span class="k">done</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I use the status bar to display some basic system information. You can
see from
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src/36ae3d14507b/Scripts/wmfs-status" title="Script in bitbucket repo">my status script</a>
that most of it is simply piping commands through the awesomeness that
is <a href="http://awk.info/" title="Awk Community Portal">awk</a>.</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought that I would find a replacement for dwm, but WMFS is a
serious contender. It has all of the functionality out-of-the-box,
including:</p>

<ul>
<li>pre-set layout per tag</li>
<li>rules to send applications to specific tags</li>
<li>completely customizable keybinds, and – as a bonus,</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi" title="Wikipedia page">Vi</a>-driven
command interface</li>
</ul>


<p>Unlike dwm, it requires no patching for any of this. It has been
completely stable while I have been using it and, while not as light as
dwm, it is still in the minimalist camp in terms of size.</p>
