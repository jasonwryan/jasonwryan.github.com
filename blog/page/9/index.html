  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/ubuntu-logo.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I have been experiencing problems with my wifi LAN when playing music
through
<a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki" title="Music Player Daemon homepage">mpd</a>
or watching movies. My upload speeds would climb to around 120-130Kb/s
and my wifi would just go down.</p>

<p>Apart from being frustrating, this was inconvenient as it meant that if
I was doing either of those things, my stereo in the living room
couldn’t stream music from my
<a href="http://www.mysqueezebox.com/index/Home" title="Squeezebox home">squeezebox server</a>, or
other members of the family (or guests) couldn’t connect to the access
point to get online.</p>

<p>After asking on
<a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/45772/playing-music-or-movies-kills-my-wifi" title="My question on Ask Ubuntu">Ask Ubuntu</a>
(which, like many of the Ubuntu-related fora is populated with people
who are more well-intentioned than they are knowledgeable - which seems
to me one of the fundamental problems the distro has; but I’ll save that
rant for another day), one helpful user suggested I use
<a href="http://www.wireshark.org/" title="Wireshark website">wireshark</a> to diagnose
the network traffic.</p>

<p>I <em>really</em> should have thought of that myself. Nonetheless, it was
immediately instructive. Wireshark quickly identified that, as soon as I
started mpd, one of my ports was being flooded: 46560</p>

<p><code>lsof</code> showed that pulse audio was the culprit:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>pulseaudi 2190 jason 39u IPv4 14110 0t0 UDP mybox:56751-&gt;224.0.0.56:46560
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>Quelle surprise… When software engineers want a case study of opacity
and abstraction from the user, this should be their first port of call.</p>

<p>Worse, it is a known bug.
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/411688" title="Pulse bug on launchpad">First logged in August, 2009</a>.
And apparently insufficiently serious to warrant any attention. Fair
enough, I suppose, given the fix is easy enough <em>if you know what you
are trying to fix…</em></p>

<p>Install the Pulse audio preferences tool:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install papref
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>…and disable Multicast/RTP.</p>

<p>Another example for me of Ubuntu’s fast waning utility as a distribution
for people that want to be able to exercize some control over their
system. It is only still installed on this machine because there isn’t
an official <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mirrors" title="Arch wiki mirror list">Arch Linux mirror</a>
here and, with my international traffic capped to 30Kb/s until last
month, I wasn’t prepared to try and run a distro on that sort of
bandwidth. Now that has changed, I suspect that Ubuntu’s days are
numbered on this box.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/quora1.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I joined <a href="http://www.quora.com/" title="Quora: Q&amp;A site">Quora</a> early in the
new year and, while
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/23/why-i-don%E2%80%99t-buy-the-quora-hype/" title="TC article on the hype">the hype has in no way abated</a>,
I have found that increasingly over the months that I have been
visiting, there is less and less reason for me to return on any regular
basis. And this puzzles me as I think the concept is, for me, an
attractive one.</p>

<p>In the five-odd months I have been visiting the site, I have managed to
<a href="http://www.quora.com/Jason-Ryan" title="My Quora profile">contribute 58 answers</a>
and over one hundred edits (more on that below); this strikes me as a reasonable
commitment on my part and one that should return some dividend to me –
at least in terms of satisfaction with the site. Alas, no.</p>

<p>And why not? For several reasons. And reasons that have only really
become apparent over the last month as I started to spend time on the
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/" title="Unix and Linux Stack Exchange">Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange site</a>.
The contrast between the <em>experience</em> of the two sites, that are in
essence very similar, couldn’t be more striking.</p>

<p>The primary difference between the two is that Unix.SE isn’t a social
site: you don’t follow anyone. Which, when you think about Q&amp;A sites,
makes a lot more sense than Quora’s model. I still don’t understand the
point of following people on Quora. Perhaps I am not following enough
people, or the wrong ones, but I have yet to see <em>any benefit</em> in
following on the site.</p>

<p>One other area of seeming similarity between the sites is the ability to
vote up (or down) questions and answers. On Unix.SE, this is implemented
as a real strength as these votes determine contributor’s reputation,
described thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>Reputation is a rough measurement of how much the community trusts
you. Reputation is never given, it is earned by convincing fellow
users that you know what you’re talking about.</p></blockquote>

<p>This has a twofold effect: it motivates contributors to provide quality
answers (and
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/badges" title="StackExchange badges">rewards</a>
them when they do), and more importantly, gives you a heuristic for how
credible an answer may be. Quora doesn’t have this concept and, for me,
is much the poorer for it.</p>

<p>Reputation has consequences on Unix.SE: the more you accrue, the more
privileges on the site you are granted. Again, this builds the
community’s capability while encouraging individual contributors.</p>

<p>Some of the other areas where Quora is really left wanting in comparison
to Unix.SE are around the design of the site. The text box where you
enter your answers or edits is a case in point:</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/quora2.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>On Quora, it is like trying to change a car battery through a letterbox.
The single, overriding impression is that entering information into the
site is neither a priority nor pleasurable which, for a site aspiring to
be a knowledge repository is incredibly perverse.</p>

<p>This is compounded by the fact that the tools for presenting the
information that you want to add to the site can charitably be described
as rudimentary (one of the reasons that I have 100-odd edits is that it
takes at least two to three attempts to present information in a
semi-acceptable fashion). Searching for
“<a href="http://www.quora.com/Quora-product/Are-there-any-markup-tags-when-writing-a-question?q=quora+markup+tools" title="Recursion alert">quora markup tools</a>”
is as disappointing as it is frustrating.</p>

<p>Being able to present information appropriately is critical. The
StackExchange sites
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/editing-help" title="Unix.SE editing guidleines">allow all sorts</a>
of HTML tags and
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" title="markdown syntax">markdown</a>,
without apparently any additional
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" title="Wikipedia page on Cross site scripting">XSS risk</a><sup>1</sup>.
The result is questions and answers that are formatted in a way that
enhances their legibility, rather than detracting from it.</p>

<p>There are some other areas where Quora is not measuring up for me:
opaque editorial and moderation policies and practices and an
unwillingness to more actively curate the questions – and no, those two
statements are not contradictory.</p>

<p>The overall impression I am left with is that while both sites have
similar aims (albeit Unix.SE’s is much more specific in terms of the
subject matter), Quora seems to me to be really failing at building a
community around it. Unless, of course, you count social media experts…</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>

<ol>
<li>God knows if that is actually the reason they refuse to allow
potential contributors the ability to adequately format their
information, but it seems plausible enough.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonwryan/5754227102/in/photostream" title="Tyrs photo on Flickr"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/tyrs.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>I have been a solid user of
<a href="http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/" title="TTYtter homepage">TTYtter</a>
for a couple of years now, much preferring the speed and power of a
command line Twitter client. And, after having tried–at one time or
another–most of the Linux or cross-platform Twitter clients, I can
safely say that for me TTYtter is easily the best.</p>

<p>There is, however, a new
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/" title="ncurses page">ncurses</a> client
that is showing a lot of promise:
<a href="http://tyrs.nicosphere.net/index.html" title="Tyrs homepage">Tyrs</a>. Only at
the 0.2.1.1 stage, and with a fraction of the functionality that TTYtter
has, it is nevertheless a very nice client.</p>

<p>Requiring little in the way of dependencies, only python-twitter and
python-oauth2, both available in the
<a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/" title="Arch Linux User Repository">AUR</a> or in the
debian/Ubuntu repos (if you are using debian/Ubuntu, you will need the
newer python-twitter-0.8.2 for it to run).</p>

<p>Tyrs is easy to configure, with good documentation and a simple
configuration file, located by default at
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tyrs/tyrs.cfg. The default keybinds are
<a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="THE editor">Vim-centric</a>, naturally…</p>

<p>My config is pretty straightforward at this point:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'>[keys]
</span><span class='line'>retweet           <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">p</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>[<span class="k">colors</span>]
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">highlight</span>         <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">1</span>
</span><span class='line'>header            <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">6</span>
</span><span class='line'>hashtag           <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">4</span>
</span><span class='line'>attag             <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">2</span>
</span><span class='line'>text              <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">7</span>
</span><span class='line'>warning_msg       <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">1</span>
</span><span class='line'>info_msg          <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">2</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>[params]
</span><span class='line'>refresh           <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">1</span>
</span><span class='line'>tweet_border      <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">0</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>Written in Python, the code is well commented and relatively easy to
find your way around if your are keen on hacking.</p>

<p>The developer, Nicolas Paris, is both approachable and helpful and is
actively developing Tyrs. With some more functionality in the pipeline,
it looks to be a very nice application.</p>
