  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/terminal.png" title="The Command Line" >
One of the almost inevitable consequences of using Arch Linux for any length of
time is that you will find yourself, if you weren&#8217;t already, sucked into the
gravitational vortex of the command line. The drive to continually understand,
refine and customize your setup, your workflow and the tools you use on a daily
basis will surely lead you to the point where you go from having one of those
dinky terminal emulators that scrolls down when you hit <kbd>F12</kbd>, to waking
up one day after yet another sleepless night trying to get your head around
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" title="Wikipedia entry">C</a> or
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell" title="Haskell wiki">Haskell</a>—so that
you can hack your tiling window manager to manage the dozen or so terminals
you constantly have open to your increasingly exacting specifications…</p>

<p>Once you resign yourself to this inevitability, it is a natural progression to
invest some time in setting up your terminal so that it is a pleasant, productive
environment. The first step is to choose your terminal emulator. After playing
with a few, I have settled on
<a href="http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html" title="Urxvt website">rxvt-unicode</a>.
Urxvt has a number of nice features, principally the ability to run in daemon
mode and, when combined with Bert Münnich&#8217;s
<a href="https://github.com/muennich/urxvt-perls/" title="Frickin genius…">urxvt-perls</a> extension,
to be able to interact with text and <acronym title="Unique Resources Locators">URLs</acronym>
with the keyboard.</p>

<p>I have also, over the last two or three months, been intermittently using
<a href="https://github.com/thestinger/termite" title="Github repo">termite</a>; the VTE-based
terminal developed by
<a href="https://github.com/thestinger" title="Github repos">Daniel Micay</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/vodik" title="Simon's Github repos">Simon Gomizelj</a>.</p>

<p>The next step is to select a colour scheme that, after long hours of peering at
the screen, won&#8217;t leave you with the eyesight of a mediæval monk. I have settled
on a dark scheme that is relatively low contrast, so works well in natural and
artificial light.<sup>1</sup> Combine this with a
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/centurion/src/tip/.vim/colors" title="bitbucket repo">custom Vim colourscheme</a>
for syntax highlighting, and you have the base for a consistent aesthetic
experience in your terms.</p>

<p>The cornucopia of choice that is GNU/Linux means that in addition to choosing
your font, you also can choose how it is rendered. I use the
<a href="http://www.infinality.net/blog/" title="Infinality blog">infinality patchset</a>,
but if you are looking for a pre-rolled version I can highly recommend
bohoomil&#8217;s
<a href="http://bohoomil.cu.cc/" title="bohoomil's documentation">infinality bundle</a>.</p>

<p>The final element—and probably the most important—is the actual shell that you
will run in your terminals.
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html" title="GNU bash page">Bash</a> is installed
everywhere (or, more correctly, everywhere that matters), so that is a solid choice.
If you are looking for a <em>lot</em> more power and flexibility, then you want
<a href="http://www.zsh.org/" title="Zsh home">Zsh</a> (with the
<a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting" title="Github repo">syntax highlights</a>
plugin).</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you are the sort of person with tribal piercings
and a fixie, you might want to look at
<a href="http://www.tcsh.org/" title="Their website says it all, really…">tcsh</a>, or even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell" title="Wikipedia page">csh</a><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Customizing your shell can, in this context, be extended to practically Escheresque
extremes. The prompt, particularly in Zsh, can print relevant information,
helpfully colour coded; but it can also metastasize into a bloated ratmangle of
unicode, complete with git branches, the weather in four different timezones and
random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_%28Unix%29" title="Wikipedia entry">fortunes</a>.
If, through some inexplicable turn of events, you find yourself staring at
something like this, it is time to seek help. Urgently.</p>

<p>For Zsh, I have the hostname (to avoid confusion when SSH&#8217;ing between machines,
the current working directory and, if the exit status is anything other than <code>0</code>
for the last command, that status is appended.</p>

<p>There is one other important choice to make in your shell: to run it in emacs
mode (the default) or vi-mode. This decision says as much about your competence
as it does about your overall contribution to the gene pool, so consider it carefully.
I have previously expressed my
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2011/12/01/readline/" title="Blog post on same">preference for vi-mode</a>,
and using Zsh (which doesn&#8217;t use readline) has just entrenched that view for me.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, you end up with an interface that is as attractive to
work with as it is powerful. You have syntax highlighting, command completion
(and with Zsh, impressive correction), coloured URLs that
can be activated with the keyboard, the ability to copy and paste between
terminals and into documents or browsers, configurable keybinds, aliases and
functions limited only by your imagination and the threshold of your indolence.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post_images/terms.png"></p>

<p>One final recommendation: consider using a terminal multiplexer like tmux to
manage your terminal sessions. I have posted quite a bit about it
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/categories/tmux/" title="tmux posts">in the past</a> and it
continues to be a mainstay of my working environment. The
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org" title="THE wiki">Arch Wiki</a>, naturally,
has some very detailed pages on each and every aspect of using the terminal.
All of my configs are available in my bitbucket repositories:

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/kernel.jpg" title="Kernels on Flickr" >
While chasing edits on the Arch Wiki a couple of weeks ago, I stumbled upon
this page:
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernels/Compilation/Traditional" title="What it says on the tin…">Kernels/Compilation/Traditional</a>;
fortuitously, it transpired. For it piqued my interest sufficiently for me to
try my hand at compiling my own kernel, and—after half a dozen attempts at
getting it right—I had no sooner switched to my custom built kernel as the
default in my boot manager when 3.10.2 landed in [testing] and would not boot.
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=167090" title="Forum thread">At all</a>.</p>

<p>I still have no idea why 3.10.2 would do nothing other than fail silently, but
the convenience of having another kernel to switch to without needing a rescue
image or any other panicked interventions immediately won me over. In the years
that I have used Arch, this was my
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/07/19/breakage/" title="Post on the Myth of Breakage">first near brush</a>
with an unbootable system<sup>1</sup> and the small amount of effort required to
mitigate this risk with a custom or alternate kernel seems a smart investment to
me at this point.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>The documentation on the wiki is both comprehensive and easy to follow. The
lessons I learned between kernels zero and three or four were mostly around
ensuring the correct modules were configured into the build. One surefire way to
make this a tedious and laborious process, should you be so inclined, is to
blindly enable and disable settings in <code>menuconfig</code>.</p>

<p>Around about the time of the fourth failed build (well, the builds were working
but the kernel wasn&#8217;t booting or was booting with missing functionality), I
decided to switch approaches and go down the <code>localmodconfig</code> route. This, for
someone with my limited experience with this aspect of GNU/Linux, was in
retrospect a decision I should have made sooner.</p>

<p>First, I started with <span class="file">streamline_config.pl</span>, a helpful
script that allows you to create a <span class="file">.config</span> file
containing only those modules necessary to your currently running
kernel<sup>3</sup>. This yielded a booting kernel at the first attempt. It turns
out, though, that you still need to ensure that <em>all</em> of the modules you are
going to need, <em>at any time in the future</em>, are loaded. I missed a couple.</p>

<p>Then I discovered this script by graysky,
<a href="https://github.com/graysky2/modprobed_db" title="In graysky2's github repo">modprobed_db</a>.
For a newbie to kernel compilation, this is simply invaluable. It allows you to
create a record of your used modules over time, compare it with those that are
currently loaded and then—right before you <code>make localmodconfig</code>—load the
remaining necessary ones. Foolproof kernel compilation. Just like that.
Brilliant. And, naturally enough, it is in
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/modprobed_db/" title="AUR package">the AUR</a>.</p>

<p>Run the script, create your <span class="file">.conf</span> file and database in
<span class="file">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/modprobed_db{,.conf}</span> and then either
call it from a <code>cron</code> job or, if you are impatient like me, spend a frenzied 10
minutes plugging ALL the devices you own into your machine, and you are good to
go. Running <code>sudo modprobed_db recall</code> will load all of the required modules,
you generate your kernel <span class="file">.config</span>, check it to make
sure it is complete and then run <code>make</code>.</p>

<p>On my laptop, I have 115 modules activated for a build, 10 of which need to be
recalled prior to creating the <span class="file">.config</span>. When I was
trying to debug 3.10.2, I compiled the vanilla Arch kernel using
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Abs" title="Wiki page on Arch Build System">ABS</a>
and it took almost exactly 60 minutes using all four threads on my i5. Building
my own kernel is done and installed in under 10.</p>

<p>I susbcribed to the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/feeds/kdist.xml" title="Kernel updates">RSS feed for kernel versions</a>
and now, whenever a new stable kernel is posted, I <code>wget</code> it, compile it and
boot from it. As new Arch versions appear in the repositories, they are updated
by <code>pacman</code> and happily coexist on my <span class="file">/boot</span>; thereby
ensuring that the likelihood of me being unable to boot my machine (other than
through
<acronym title="Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair">PEBKAC</acronym>)
has hopefully been staved off for another five years.</p>

<p>The next step would be to write a script that completely automates the process…</p>

<h3>Update 7/8/13</h3>

<p>After poring over PKGBUILDS in the AUR, principally graysky&#8217;s
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-ck/" title="Arch User Repository">linux-ck PKGBUILD</a>,
and the official
<a href="https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/tree/trunk?h=packages/linux" title="Arch SVN Package Repo">ABS PKGBUILD</a>,
I decide to write my own to automate the above. It works well enough for me, but
hasn&#8217;t been tested more widely. You will need to ensure that you have an
up-to-date <code>modprobed_db</code> database with all of your required modules listed and
that you have configured <code>sudoers</code> to have this run from the PKGBUILD.</p>

<p>The PKGBUILD and the attendant files are in my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/tip/Build/linux-jwr" title="PKGBUILD and related files">bitbucket repo</a>:
let me know if there are any issues with this approach.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/key-board.jpg" title="Encrypted mail" >
With the torrent of recent revelations about the enthusiasm with which
the governments of most of the first world have been systematically and
unlawfully violating the privacy of their citizens by intercepting their digital
communications, I thought it worth adding to the posts I have written about
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/categories/mutt/" title="Posts on mutt">Mutt</a>—that most
peerless of email clients—specifically how, combined with
<a href="http://gnupg.org/" title="GPG home page">GnuPG</a>, you can encrypt all of your mail and
ensure that the only person reading it is the intended recipient.</p>

<p>The definitive guide for this setup remains Justin Miller&#8217;s venerable page,
<a href="http://codesorcery.net/old/mutt/mutt-gnupg-howto" title="The title says it all, really…">Everything You Need To Know To Start Using GnuPG with Mutt</a>,
last edited in 2001 and <em>still</em> the authoritative source. The setup I will
describe differs only insofar as it covers how to use multiple keys associated
with different mail accounts. Mutt gives you the flexibility sign or encrypt all
of the email in your work account with one key, and your personal email with
another.</p>

<p>Once you have set up your GPG keys<sup>1</sup>, the first step is to configure
Mutt to use your keys. You can include these directives in your
<span class="file">muttrc</span> but, in the interests of readability, I prefer
to split them out into <span class="file">gpg.rc</span> and source them from
<span class="file">muttrc</span>. The settings are self-explanatory, those most
relevant to this post control how mutt handles your mail with respect to
encryption or just signing<sup>2</sup>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">pgp_use_gpg_agent</span> <span class="o">=</span> yes
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">pgp_sign_as</span> <span class="o">=</span> 43A5CE95
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">pgp_timeout</span> <span class="o">=</span> 3600
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">crypt_autosign</span> <span class="o">=</span> yes
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">crypt_replyencrypt</span> <span class="o">=</span> yes
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>This sets my work key as the primary key and a couple of other sane (for me)
defaults. All of these options are described in <code>muttrc(5)</code>.
You can see my complete file in my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/default/.mutt/gpg.rc" title="mutt config files">bitbucket repo</a>.</p>

<p>The rest of the recipe is in <span class="file">muttrc</span>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">source</span> ~/.mutt/gpg.rc            <span class="c"># use GPG</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># gpg key</span>
</span><span class='line'>send-hook <span class="s2">&quot;~f @catalyst.net.nz&quot;</span>  <span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">pgp_sign_as</span><span class="o">=</span>43A5CE95
</span><span class='line'>send-hook <span class="s2">&quot;~f @jasonwryan.com&quot;</span>   <span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">pgp_sign_as</span><span class="o">=</span>B1BD4E40
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># key binds</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">bind </span>compose p  pgp-menu
</span><span class='line'>macro compose Y pfy <span class="s2">&quot;send mail without GPG&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>Sourcing the <span class="file">gpg.rc</span> reads all the relevant options
and then a series of <code>send-hooks</code> allow you to use specific keys for each of
your accounts.</p>

<p>Now, when you receive encrypted mail, if your key agent is running, Mutt will
decrypt your mail on the fly. Otherwise you will be prompted for your key
phrase. Similarly, when you send email, it will by default be signed by the key
associated with that account, and you can encrypt individual mail by bringing up
the GPG menu in the compose screen by hitting <kbd>p</kbd>.</p>

<p>And for those friends and acquaintances you correspond with for whom
encryption is the equivalent of white powder spilling from an envelope, you can
always elect to send without any GPG by selecting <kbd>Y</kbd> to send the
email.</p>

<p>These and a number of other interesting tips and macros are on the
<a href="http://dev.mutt.org/trac/wiki/MuttGuide/UseGPG" title="Using GPG">Mutt Wiki</a>
and are worth following up once you have the basics working. Like so much of
this sort of software, it takes a little longer to set up <em>exactly</em> the way that
you want it, but once you are done, it is good for decades…</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>A good introduction to this procedure is detailed in the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPG">Arch Wiki article</a>.</li>
<li>This assumes that you do want to distinguish between the two; you could, of
course, just encrypt <em>everything</em>—assuming that your correspondents were
willing and able to decrypt it…</li>
</ol>
