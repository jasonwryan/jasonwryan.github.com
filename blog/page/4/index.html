Using a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS" title="Wikipedia article">Socks proxy</a> over an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol#Secure_shell_tunneling" title="Wikipedia entry">SSH tunnel</a>
is a well documented and simple if much less flexible stand in for a full-blown
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network%20'VPN%20on%20Wikipedia">VPN</a>. It
can provide a degree of comfort when accessing private or sensitive information
over a public Internet connection, or you might use it to get around the
terminally Canutian<sup>1</sup> construct that is known as geo-blocking; that
asinine practice of pretending that the Internet observes political boundaries…</p>

<p>By way of a digression, it occurred to me at some point while I was wrestling
with setting this up that, over the last seven or so years, much of the
“entertainment” provided by corporate content distributors has been in the form
of encouraging me to spend hundreds? thousands? of hours researching and
implementing ways to circumvent their litany of failed and defective
technological restrictions: region codes,
<a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management" title="Defective by Design">DRM</a>
and the like. It is worth noting that, in the vast majority of cases, I was
just seeking access to content that I already owned (in another format), or was
prepared to pay for.</p>

<p>My move to GNU/Linux in 2007 was in large part motivated by the awful
realisation that the music I had bought in iTunes was stuck in there. The
combined intellectual effort globally expended trying to legitimately route
around broken copyright law would have comfortably powered another golden age
of the sciences; it&#8217;s not entirely implausible to think that the only reason we
still have to deal with cancer is the malignant legacy of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Bono_Copyright_Term_Extension_Act" title="Sonny's gift…">Sonny Bono</a><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Now, back to our regular programming… One of my approaches to get around this
sort of economic and policy rigor mortis has been to use a basic script to
create a proxy tunnel to my home server. It assumes that you have
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography" title="Wikipedia, again">public key</a>
authentication set up and your passphrase loaded in
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_Keys#Keychain" title="Arch wiki, for a change">keychain</a>,
or something similar.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of weeks, though, while I have been setting up and
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2014/05/10/syncthing/" title="Post on Syncthing">playing with Syncthing</a>,
I found this script wanting. With six nodes and, depending if I was on the
<acronym title="Local Area Network">LAN</acronym> or not, as many as four of those
hosts only accessible via SSH, then having the ability to quickly and painlessly
open a browser on any one of the nodes <em>without having to edit the script</em>
suddenly seemed like quite a good idea.</p>

<p>Accordingly I went to work on the script, including a test to determine if I
was on my home network and passing the name of the desired host as an
argument. With this approach, I simply type <code>tunnel $host</code> and chromium
opens tunneled to that host, where I can the happily open
<strike>Hulu</strike> the Syncthing GUI.</p>

<p>The updated script is posted as
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jasonwryan/715a4f3fcb55e995de0d" title="On Github">a gist</a>,
and as you can see, still needs some work to make it a little more generic.
You will need, for example, to hand edit in the hosts and ports in
<code>get_host()</code>. It is also the first time I have played with
<a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/InputAndOutput#Pipes" title="Wooledge wiki">named pipes</a>
and I am not convinced that my use of <code>mkfifo</code> here is either the correct
approach or implementation; but it works. Comments enlightening me would
be gratefully received.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/syncthing.png" title="Syncthing logo" >
Just over a year ago, I was invited to participate in an exciting Alpha, for
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/sync" title="Sync website), an application
that allows you to sync selected directories across devices using a
[peer-to-peer protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittorent 'Wikipedia article">BitTorrent Sync</a>.
I <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/03/16/sync/" title="Click the damn thing…">wrote up my experience</a>
and, with one reservation, found it to be a fantastic tool that did pretty much everything I
needed, including letting me finally get rid of Dropbox. That one reservation, although not
entirely clear at the time, was clarified soon after and was crushingly disappointing:
the programme was closed source.</p>

<p>Due to a combination of inertia (it was installed on all my devices and working well) and
the lack of an alternative that didn&#8217;t involve installing and running a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamp_stack" title="Wikipedia page">LAMP stack</a> just to sync
my files, I have persisted with it; even writing a
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/11/14/api/" title="Post on said script">simple Awk script</a>
to interact with the <acronym title="Application Program Interface">API</acronym>.
For the last twelve months I have been pretty happy with it.</p>

<p>In addition to the licensing choice, there are some other small issues that I have discovered: the
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bittorrent.sync" title="On Google Play">Android App</a>
<em>chews</em> through your battery if it is left on (which sort of defeats the purpose, but I
learned to live with it), the syncing can take a little while to pick up changes, and
nodes that don&#8217;t see much action may flake out completely after a while.</p>

<p>Then, a few weeks ago I read about <a href="https://github.com/jewel/clearskies" title="On Github">clearskies</a>,
an open source implementation of this concept. Sadly, it is still a proof of
concept. This discovery, however, led to an extremely fortuitous exchange
<a href="https://twitter.com/csantosb/status/460714748322258944" title="Twitter conversation">on Twitter</a>
with <a href="https://twitter.com/csantosb" title="His profile on Twitter">cayetano santos</a> who pointed me
at <a href="http://syncthing.net/" title="Syncthing homepage">Syncthing</a>. Described thus (cue
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YaGwI7GjlA" title="G.F. Handel on Youtube">background music</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>Syncthing replaces Dropbox and BitTorrent Sync with something open, trustworthy and decentralized. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, if it is shared with some third party and how it&#8217;s transmitted over the Internet.</p></blockquote>


<p>Written in <a href="http://golang.org/" title="Go language site">Go</a>, Syncthing is still in
early development, but judging by the
<a href="https://github.com/calmh/syncthing/releases" title="Releases on Github">release history</a>,
it is moving ahead quickly. The developer, <a href="https://nym.se/" title="Jakob's site">Jakob Borg</a>,
is obviously both talented and productive. After using it for the last
couple of weeks, I have uninstalled BitTorrent Sync from all my machines
and have Syncthing set up and running nicely. It is simple, elegant and
works wonderfully; <em>for what it does</em>.</p>

<p>Which is to say that it is not all of the things that either of its
predecessors are: it isn&#8217;t intended to distribute files, or to host images or
simple websites. It doesn&#8217;t include versioning or have a built-in editor. It is
for securely syncing your files independent of any third parties. And there is no
Android app, so your battery is safe<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>Setup is through a tidy, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" title="Bootstrap site">bootstrap</a>
built web interface, by default running on <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code>. I subsequently found
that once I understood how the configuration worked, editing the config file at
<span class="file">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/syncthing/config.xml</span> was much
simpler.  When setting up, you will also do a lot of stopping and starting of
<code>syncthing</code>; if you use the service file that comes with the
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/syncthing/" title="Arch User Repo">AUR package</a>,
that won&#8217;t work so well from the web interface… Run it from the command line
with one of the <code>STTRACE</code> variables to debug and then, once it is running to
your liking, hand it off to systemd<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>With a reasonably tricky cluster setup (six machines; two outside the
<acronym title="Local Area Network">LAN</acronym> sharing half a dozen
repositories with three different topologies), there is a fair bit of trial and
error involved getting everything set up and working correctly. But when you
do, it is much faster to pick up changes than either of the other two and there
is none of the risk around privacy and security presented by Dropbox and—to a
(much, I would hazard to guess) lesser extent—BitTorrent Sync.</p>

<p>I have also found that it is much quicker for all of the nodes connect if,
for the LAN connections in your cluster, you specify the
<acronym title="Internet Protocol">IP</acronym> addresses and port and disable
global discovery for those nodes: this speeds up the discovery time when
the nodes are started. Nodes still, from time-to-time, flake out, particularly
if one of them is rebooted. Restarting the offending node is usually sufficient
to bring the cluster back into sync.</p>

<p>That isn&#8217;t to say that there aren&#8217;t any issues with it. The documentation is in
need of some work; your best bet at the moment is a combination of the rather
terse <code>--help</code> message and reading the source. There are also some hidden gems
in the Github commits; for example, details on using
<span class="file">.stignore</span> files, a very handy feature, are buried in
an earlier
<a href="https://github.com/calmh/syncthing/commit/986b15573a66f95beae53b10371ba50ab147124a" title="Github commit">commit to README.md</a> that didn&#8217;t survive the move of the documentation to the
forum.</p>

<p>The only other significant issue I have encountered is that getting all of the
nodes across the cluster to connect to each other at the same time seems to be
inexplicably difficult. It may just be my setup, but more often than not, nodes
(on the LAN) will timeout while trying to connect to at least one of their peers.
This isn&#8217;t a huge issue as you only really need one chained connection to bring
all the data up to date, but it does cause a something of a minor
<acronym title="Obsessive Compulsive Disorder">OCD</acronym> flare up.</p>

<p>Given the early stages of the project, though, and the fact that it is open
source, these anomalies are trivial. Overall, Syncthing is a delight. It does
exactly what I need it to do, and it does it securely. Given the promise it is
showing this early, I can only imagine it getting a lot better over time as
more
<a href="https://github.com/calmh/syncthing/issues?state=open" title="Issues on Github">bugs are squashed</a>
and features rolled out.</p>

<li>Naturally enough, someone is <a href="https://github.com/calmh/syncthing/issues/177">on the case</a>…

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/crowd.jpg" title="Creative Commons crowd image" >
Late last month there was a post on
<a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/251758/why-is-stack-overflow-so-negative-of-late" title="All the hate…">Meta Stack Overflow</a> wondering why SO is “so negative of late.” Reading through the
extensive list of answers, and all the comments that quickly adhered to them
like barnacles on a becalmed schooner, it was hard not to extrapolate to the
experiences of online communities elsewhere, especially in the free and open
software world. Stack Overflow is going on six years old now and has grown to
be a truly formidable<sup>1</sup> resource for programmers, <em>dilettantes</em>—the
category to which I clearly belong—and, apparently, people wanting their
homework done for them. This isn&#8217;t the first time this question has been raised
there, and I am sure it won&#8217;t be the last.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t spend <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/712613/jasonwryan" title="My SO profile">much time on SO</a>,
mostly because I am not a programmer and so I don&#8217;t have much to contribute there, but also because
I <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/users/6761/jasonwryan" title="U&amp;L profile">am active on Unix &amp; Linux</a><sup>2</sup>,
one of the clones that has emerged out of the metastasizing StackExchange
empire. I do, however, subscribe to quite a few of the <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym>
feeds for question tags on SO: things like #awk, #bash, and other topics that are of interest
to me. Given the amount of noise in these feeds; in the form of redundancy (ie., questions
that have been asked in one form or another <em>many</em> times before) or just a signal failure to read
<em>any</em> documentation, it is not surprising that the people responsible for this degradation
see the site as negative, or unfriendly, or elitist. This is perfectly natural: it is the
community attempting to defend itself from
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/03/17/vampires/" title="Post on the scourge">help vampires</a>.</p>

<p>What was also quite predictable, given StackExchange&#8217;s response to this “problem” which was the
2012 <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/07/kicking-off-the-summer-of-love/" title="SE Blog post">Summer of Love</a>
campaign where they wanted to make SO a more friendly place, was that this would only
exacerbate the issue. My experience of the site over that time is that the signal to noise has
not improved at all, quite the contrary. I think that setting an expectation that the site
would be more welcoming has two perverse consequences: first, it validates the perceptions
of the newcomers about purported hostility, and in doing so signals to the existing community
that built the value of the site that their culture needs remediation. Secondly, it signals
more tolerance for behaviours that add no value to the community; so it is hardly surprising
to see those behaviours proliferate.</p>

<p>From time to time the Arch community faces exactly the same criticisms: we are unfriendly,
or elitist. I neither agree with these types of comments, nor am I particularly perturbed by
them. Arch is a small community of volunteers, in order to create an environment where people
who are willing and able to actively contribute, I think is important to ensure that there
are clearly articulated standards<sup>3</sup> and that they are maintained by the
community at large.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see any scope for increasing the community&#8217;s tolerance for vampirism or the sort
of self-entitlement that has a sad habit of appearing from time-to-time:</p>

<blockquote> As for the Arch team and their lacking resources, let&#8217;s take your point at face value.  Now, we&#8217;ve known what the problem is for almost four hours and no fix has been issued.</blockquote>


<p>There is some sort of “problem” that “we” have known about for <em>four hours</em> and
yet, inconceivably<sup>4</sup>, <em>nothing</em> has been done about it?</p>

<p>There is no bug report on the <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/" title="Flyspray">Arch tracker</a> so
I am not sure why the collective pronoun is warranted here, that quibble aside; in what
universe is this sort of petulance considered acceptable? The only reasonable response
to this sort of whining is to close the thread and ban the infractor and their progeny, who
will no doubt suffer from the same sort of genetic deficiencies, <em>in perpetuam</em>…</p>

<p>Clearly articulating, and enforcing, minimum standards of behaviour doesn&#8217;t
make your community hostile or unfriendly; it establishes boundaries for people
that supports respectful collaboration and the effective ability of that
community to self-moderate.  People new to the community who take the time to
read the guidelines and observe how things work will have no problem
adapting<sup>5</sup>. It may not make you popular, but it will make a
significant contribution to the sustainability of the community and the levels
of engagement of those that do contribute and wish to continue doing so.</p>
