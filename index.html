  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/tarsnap-logo.png" title="Tarsnsap Logo" >
I started using <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/" title="Tarsnap website">Tarsnap</a> about
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2011/09/08/tarsnap/" title="Post on Tarsnap">three years ago</a>
and I have been nothing but impressed with it since. It is simple to use,
<em>extremely</em> cost effective and, more than once, it has saved me from myself;
making it easy to retrieve copies of files that I have inadvertently
overwritten or otherwise done stupid things with<sup>1</sup>.  When I
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2011/09/08/tarsnap/" title="Post on Tarsnap">first posted about it</a>,
I included a
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/tip/Scripts/snap" title="In Bitbucket repo">simple wrapper script</a>,
which has held up pretty well over that time.</p>

<p>What became apparent over the last couple of months, as I began to consciously
make more regular backups, was that pruning the archives was a relatively
tedious business. Given that Tarsnap
<a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/efficiency.html" title="Tarsnap efficiency page">de-duplicates data</a>,
there isn&#8217;t much mileage in keeping around older archives because, if you do
have to retrieve a file, you don&#8217;t want to have to search through a large
number of archives to find it; so there is a balance between making use of
Tarsnap&#8217;s efficient functionality, and not creating a rod for your back if your
use case is occasionally retrieving single—or small groups of—files, rather
than large dumps.</p>

<p>I have settled on keeping five to seven archives, depending on the frequency of
my backups, which is somewhere around two to three times a week. Pruning these
archives was becoming tedious, so I wrote a simple script to make it less
onerous. Essentially, it writes a list of all the archives to a
<span class="file">tmpfile</span>, runs
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/sort" title="sort man page">sort(1)</a>
to order them from oldest to newest, and then deletes the oldest minus whatever
the number to keep is set to.</p>

<p>The bulk of the code is simple enough:</p>

<p>You can see the rest of the script in
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/tip/Scripts/snapclean" title="snapclean in bitbucket">my bitbucket repo</a>.  It even comes <a href="/images/post_images/snapclean.png" title="Screenshot of snapclean">with colour</a>.</p>

<p>Once every couple of weeks, I run the script, review the archives marked for
deletion and then blow them away. Easy. If you aren&#8217;t using Tarsnap, you
really should check it out; it is an excellent service and—for the almost
ridiculously small investment—you get rock solid, encrypted peace of
mind. Why would you not do that?</p>

<h3>Coda</h3>

<p>This is the <em>one hundredth</em> post on this blog: a milestone that I never
envisaged getting anywhere near. Looking back through the posts, nearly 60,000
words worth, there are a couple there that continue to draw traffic and are
obviously seen at some level as helpful.  There are also quite a few that
qualify as “filler”, but blogging is a discipline like any other and sometimes
you just have to push something up to keep the rhythm going. In any event, this
is a roundabout way of saying that, for a variety of reasons both personal and
professional, I am no longer able to fulfil my own expectations of regularly
pushing these posts out.</p>

<p>I will endeavour to, from time to time when I find something that I genuinely
think is worth sharing, make an effort to write about it, but I can&#8217;t see that
happening all that often.  I&#8217;d like to thank all the people that have read
these posts; especially those of you that have commented. With every post, I
always looked forward to people telling me where I got something wrong or how I
could have approached a problem differently or more effectively<sup>2</sup>; I
learned a lot from these pointers and I am grateful to the people that were
generous enough to share them.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>The frequency with which this happens is, admittedly, low; but not
low enough to confidently abandon a service like this…</li>
<li>Leaving a complimentary note is just as welcome, don&#8217;t get me wrong…</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/agra.jpg" title="Creative Commons image of Agra" >
One of the easiest ways to contribute to Arch is to maintain a package, or
packages, in the
<acronym title="Arch User Repository"><a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/" title="AUR homepage">AUR</a></acronym>;
the repository of user contributed PKGBUILDs that extends the range of packages available
for Arch by some magnitude. Given that PKGBUILDs are just shell scripts, the barrier
to entry is relatively low, and investing the small amount of effort required to clear
that barrier will not only give you a much better understanding of how packaging works
in Arch, but will scratch your own itch for a particular package and hopefully assuage
someone else&#8217;s similar desire at the same time.</p>

<p>Now that I have a
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" title="Raspberry Pi site">Raspberry Pi</a><sup>1</sup>, I am
naturally much more interested in packages that can be built for the ARMv6
architecture; especially those that are available in the AUR. It is worth a brief
digression to note that
<a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/" title="AL ARM home page">Arch Linux ARM</a> is an entirely
<em>separate</em> distribution and, while they share features with Arch, support for
each is restricted to their respective communities. It is with this
consideration in mind that I had begun to think about multi-arch support in
PKGBUILDs, particularly in the packages that I maintain in the AUR.</p>

<p>I have
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2014/05/10/syncthing/" title="Post on Syncthing">previously posted</a>
about using <a href="http://syncthing.net/" title="Open source synching: genius…">Syncthing</a>
across my network, including on a Pi as one of the nodes. As the Syncthing
developer pushes out a release at least weekly, I have been maintaining my own
PKGBUILD and, after Syncthing was pulled into [community], I uploaded it to the
AUR as
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/syncthing-bin" title="AUR package">syncthing-bin</a>.</p>

<p>Syncthing is a cross platform application so it runs on a wide range of
architectures, including ARM (both v6 and v7). Initially, when I wrote the
PKGBUILD, I would <code>updpkgsums</code> on my x86_64 machine, build the package and
then, on the Pi, have to regenerate the integrity checks. This was manageable
enough for my own use across two architectures, but wasn&#8217;t really going to
work for people using other architectures (especially if they are using
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/04/09/helpers/" title="My post on Yaourt">AUR helpers</a>).</p>

<p>Naturally enough, this started me thinking about how I could more effectively
manage the process of updating the PKGBUILD for each new release, <em>and</em> have it
work across the four architectures—without having to manually copy and paste or
anything similarly tedious. Managing multiple architectures in the PKGBUILD
itself is not particularly problematic, a case statement is sufficient:</p>

<p>The real challenge, for me, was to be able to script the replacement of each of
the respective
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha1sum" title="Wikipedia entry">sha1sums</a>,
and then to update the PKGBUILD with the new arrays.  Each release of
Syncthing is accompanied by a text file containing all of the sha1sums, each on
its own line in a conveniently ordered format, like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>sha1sums.txt.asc </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>b2e1961594a931201799246f5cf61cb1e1700ff9    syncthing-linux-386-v0.9.16.tar.gz

<p>This seemed a perfect job for Awk, or more particularly, <code>gawk</code>&#8217;s

<p>The remaining step was to update the PKGBUILD with the new sha1sums. Fortunately,
<a href="http://blog.falconindy.com/" title="Dave's blog">Dave Reisner</a> had already written the code

<p>Combining these two tasks means that I have a script that, when run, will download
the current Syncthing release&#8217;s <span class="file">sha1sum.txt.asc</span>
file, extract the relevant sums into the replacement case statement and then
write it into the PKGBUILD. I can then run <code>makepkg -ci &amp;&amp; mkaurball</code>, upload
the new tarball to the AUR and the two other people that are using the PKGBUILD
can download it and not have to generate new sums before installing their
shiny, new version of Syncthing. You can see the full version of the script in
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/shiv/src/tip/Scripts/upsync" title="Tip…">my bitbucket repo</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/post_images/alarm_clock.jpg" title="Creative Commons image" >
Due to a rather embarrassing episode in #archlinux a couple of weeks ago,
where I naively shared one of the first bash scripts I had written without
first looking back over it<sup>1</sup>, and had to subsequently endure what
felt like the ritual
<a href="http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/2013-02-24/" title="Classic Dilbert strip">code mocking</a>,
but was in fact some helpful pointers as to how I could make the script suck
less (a <em>lot</em> less) I have been going through those older scripts and applying
the little knowledge that I have picked up in the interim; reappraising the
usefulness of the scripts as I go.</p>

<p>One that has proved to be of some utility for many years now is a simple
wrapper script I wrote to help manage my finances. Like many useful scripts, it
was written quickly and has been in constant use ever since; becoming almost
transparent it is so ingrained in my workflow.</p>

<p>The script allows me to manage the lag between when a company emails me an
invoice and when the payment is actually due. I find that companies will
typically email their invoices to me some weeks in advance, whereupon I will
make a mental note and then, unsurprisingly, promptly forget all about it,
thereby opening myself up for penalties for late payment.  It didn&#8217;t take me
long (well, in my defence, a lot less time than it took for invoices to become
digital) to realise that there was a better way™ - a script.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/at.html" title="POSIX spec">at command</a>
is purpose built for running aperiodic commands at a later time (whereas
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html" title="POSIX spec">cron</a>
is for periodic tasks). So, using at(1), once I receive an invoice, I can set a
reminder closer to the final payment window, thereby avoiding both the late
payment penalty—and the loss of interest were I to pay it on receipt. I just
needed a script to make it painless to achieve.</p>

<p>The main function of the script is pretty self-explanatory:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>todo </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>aread<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">read</span> -p <span class="s2">&quot;Time of message? [HH:MM] &quot;</span> attime
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">read</span> -p <span class="s2">&quot;Date of message? [DD.MM.YY] &quot;</span> atdate
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">read</span> -p <span class="s2">&quot;Message body? &quot;</span> message

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">datexp</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;^[0-9]{2}.[0-9]{2}.[0-9]{2}&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$attime</span> <span class="o">=</span>~ <span class="nv">$timexp</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nv">$atdate</span> <span class="o">=</span>~ <span class="nv">$datexp</span> <span class="o">]]</span>; <span class="k">then</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">     </span>at <span class="s2">&quot;$attime&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$atdate&quot;</span> <span class="s">&lt;&lt; EOF</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">     printf &#39;%s\n&#39; &quot;$message&quot; | mutt -s &quot;REMINDER&quot; jasonwryan@gmail.com</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">EOF</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">else</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">     </span><span class="nb">printf</span> <span class="s1">&#39;%s\n&#39;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Incorrectly formatted values, bailing...&quot;</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">exit </span>1
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">fi</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></div></figure>


<p>Now, an invoice arrives, I open it and fire up
<a href="https://github.com/jasonwryan/dwm/blob/patches/patchset/Base_config_changes.patch#L85" title="patch on github">a scratchpad</a>, and follow the prompts. A couple of weeks later, the
reminder email arrives and I login to my bank account and dispatch payment.
You could, of course, have the script trigger some other form of notification,
but an email works well for me.</p>

<p>The rest of the script is similarly basic; just some options for listing and
reading any queued jobs and some more rudimentary checking. The full script is
in my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/centurion/src/tip/Scripts/todo" title="todo script">bitbucket repo</a><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<h3>Update 7/09/14</h3>

<p>Not more than a couple of hours after posting this,
<a href="http://bluewind.at/">Florian Pritz</a> pinged me in #archlinux with some great suggestions
for improving the script. I particularly liked relying on date(1) handling the input format
for the time and date values. He also suggested a
<a href="http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html" title="GNU readline page">readline</a>
wrapper called (appropriately enough)
<a href="https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap" title="Github repo">rlwrap</a> and a <code>tmpfile</code> to better manage
input validation. You can see his
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jasonwryan/54fead5ad2b0c3b82621" title="Gist on github">full diff</a> of
changes. In the end, I adopted the <code>date</code> suggestion but passed on <code>rlwrap</code>. Thanks for the
great pointers, Florian.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>In the interests of full disclosure, the most egregious line was
<code>myterm=$(echo $TERM)</code> which I would hope I copied blindly from somewhere
else, but accept full responsibility for nonetheless.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t poke around too much in there, I still have quite a lot of cleaning up to do…</li>
</ol>
