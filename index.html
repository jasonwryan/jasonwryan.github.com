  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/fork.jpg" title="'Fork on Flickr'" >
Over the last couple of months there have been a number of discussions on the Arch boards
about the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Forum_Etiquette#Arch_Linux_Distribution_Support_ONLY" title="Forum Etiquette">forum policy</a>
of only providing support for Arch Linux, culminating in this
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=157361" title="Arch Forum thread">long thread about Archbang users</a>
(login required) being denied support and having their threads summarily
closed. As it emerged in the discussion, there seem to be two separate issues
at play here; the question of Arch-derivatives using the Arch brand (logo,
colours and even the forum style sheets), and how the wider community of
GNU/Linux distributions are treated on our boards.</p>

<p>The first issue is relatively simple to address. Allowing derivative
distributions to use the Arch brand is, in my view, a mistake. It dilutes the
value of the Arch “brand” and—as can be seen when people show up having
installed a derivative and thinking they are running Arch—just confuses people.</p>

<p>For some of these derivatives, like Archbang, there is an argument to be made
that once they have completed the installation process, they are in fact
running Arch, albeit an off-the-shelf version. I find this argument to be
specious. All of the derivatives that I have come across, in addition to
“simplifying”<sup>1</sup> the installation process and including <code>X</code> and some
sort of desktop or window manager by default, also make a number of other
system changes that invalidate their claim to being Arch by another name.</p>

<p>See this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/yj2v5/a_new_guibased_version_of_arch_has_gone_live/c5wc6yo" title="Reddit thread on Manjaro Linux">scathing review of Manjaro</a>
or Allan&#8217;s <a href="http://allanmcrae.com/2012/12/battle-of-the-arch-spin-offs/" title="Allan McRae's blog">roundup of the Arch Spin-Offs</a>
for the details on the decisions these developers make that mean it is not
practicable to support them on the Arch boards, nor desirable to do so in
future. As a distro, Arch is essentially vanilla packages, pacman and rolling
release, and a base on which
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way#User-centric" title="The Arch Way">you build your preferred system</a>.
Changing two of those three means that you are not running Arch…</p>

<p>That leads in to the second point, which is I&#8217;ll paraphrase as “well, we are
all Linux users, so everyone should be welcome to ask for support from Arch
users.” It is a fine sentiment, but one that is neither
<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#forum" title="ESR's seminal document">historically accurate</a>,
nor in the long term interests of Arch. I have harped on in the past about
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/03/17/vampires/" title="My post on the taxonomy of suckers…">help vampires</a>
and last year I came across the perfect illustration of the unchecked effects
of this phenomena:</p>

<blockquote><p>Right now I&#8217;d say the bug queues are flooded with bugs that you can&#8217;t really act on… It&#8217;s a strain on the project that there are so many users that don&#8217;t really get it.</p><footer><strong>Alison Randall</strong> <cite>Ubuntu Technical Architect. Linux Format July 2012</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Your bugtracker becomes essentially unusable. Your forums end up the same way.
No-one ends up getting much in the way of assistance at all, let alone anything
approaching informed help. That may be an inevitable consequence of the
collision between considerable but still finite resources and a philosophy of being
the <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> of the masses; Arch has
nothing like that in terms of resources, and a very different
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way" title="The Arch Way, again…">philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>That philosophy doesn&#8217;t include anything about shortcuts or commoditized images
for a mass user base. It doesn&#8217;t mention making the installation and
maintenance of your system completely idiot-proof so as to facilitate a
relentless march to the very top of whatever spurious distro popularity ranking
system you subscribe to. And it certainly doesn&#8217;t say anything about your
entitlement to immediate and courteous support from the Arch community in the
face of your own inability to reach a minimum level of understanding of what it
is that you have installed on your hard drive.</p>

<p>If you think that you can just skip the whole tiresome
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/02/08/documentation/" title="Post on documentation">RTFM thing</a>
by downloading a derivative and installing that, how exactly do you expect to be able
to run a rolling release distro that has, on average, a couple of
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/news/" title="Arch news">significant changes</a> every year?</p>

<p>Sooner or later you are going to have to come to terms with <em>the responsibility</em>
that is an integral part of this type of rolling release and, if you have
installed it yourself, you will be much better placed to be able to build on
that understanding and broaden and deepen your knowledge of your system.</p>

<p>That is ultimately far more satisfying for you, and much more beneficial for
the rest of the community as it means that you will be more able and likely to
contribute back in whatever way that you can; reporting bugs to a functioning
bug tracker, editing the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org" title="The finest, actually">fine Wiki</a>,
maintaining packages in <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org" title="Arch User Repository">the AUR</a>,
submitting patches, etc.  Doing all the things that will
sustain Arch and continue to make it an attractive distribution for competent
GNU/Linux users and those that are willing to invest the time to become so.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>If you have used the Arch install scripts, you would appreciate that it is
not really possible to provide a simpler installation process.</li>

One of the canards about Free and Open Source Software that is peddled by the unscrupulous
marketers of proprietary software is that their product is superior because, among other
things, the scruffy, sandal-wearing Communists that write and distribute their software
for free do not bother to adequately document that software; thereby placing in jeopardy
the business processes in the enterprise that rely on said software to continue to
profitably grease the wheels of the juggernaut of Capitalism.</p>

<p>At heart, it really is an attempt to paint FOSS as a hobbyist&#8217;s pursuit, unworthy of
consideration by Fortune 500 <acronym title="Chief Inhibiting Officers">CIOs</acronym>
as it is not in the same league as “professional,” proprietary product. This
<acronym title="Fear, Uncertainty & Doubt">FUD</acronym> is not restricted to
the usual suspects; it has also been raised by other, presumably more
<a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/5180" title="Editorial on OS News">objective commentators</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Open Source documentation is terrible. There is no kinder way to put it. Even the commercially distributed software in the Open Source world has substandard documentation. (And believe me, as a technical writer coming from the Windows world, when I tell you that the commercial industrial standards are pretty low). Only a bare handful of Open Source software packages have any documentation at all. And out of the few that do, much of it is either unfinished, inaccurate, or outdated. What counts as explanatory text among geeks would bewilder a nuclear physicist, even a sober one.</p><footer><strong>OSNews Editorial, 2003</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.osnews.com/story/5180'>www.osnews.com/story/5180/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>A more recent survey, published in 2010, identifed the same issue for businesses,
in slightly less histrionic language:</p>

<blockquote><p>The No. 1 reason for not choosing open-source solutions was lack of support followed by poor documentation.</p><footer><strong>Zenoss 2010 Survey</strong> <cite><a href='http://gigaom.com/2010/08/11/enterprise-yeah-were-cool-with-open-source/'>gigaom.com/2010/08/11/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>My experience of FOSS documentation, particularly over the last twelve months, has been just the
opposite.</p>

<p>From the middle of 2012 on, I made a couple of significant changes in my computing
environment; I moved from
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SysVinit" title="Archwiki page…">SysVinit</a>
to <a href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd" title="Project web page">systemd</a>,
garden variety to
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/01/25/uefi/" title="My post on UEFI booting">UEFI booting</a>
and changed my shell from
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" title="GNU Bash page">Bash</a> to
<a href="http://www.zsh.org/" title="Zsh homepage, one of the ugliest on the Web">Zsh</a>.
In each of these cases I found myself having to turn to the documentation the
community has provided in order to understand the implications of the change,
and to familiarise myself with the new tool or approach.</p>

<p>I posted at the time about <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/08/04/systemd/" title="The Leap to systemd">moving to systemd</a>,
and I don&#8217;t think—in retrospect—I credited Lennart Poettering enough for the series of posts
he wrote detailing the design decisions and implementation of that system;
those posts (at the time 12, now
<a href="http://0pointer.de/blog/projects" title="Lennart Poettering's blog">grown to 20</a>)
are an impressively thorough, and thoughtful, document of the new init system.</p>

<p>Similarly, when I started reading about <acronym title="Universal Extensible Firmware Interface">UEFI</acronym>
booting, I quickly found myself at <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/" title="The author of… Just go there!">Rod Smith&#8217;s site</a>.
Rod has compiled an exhaustive and authoritative resource on <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/" title="gdisk page">GPT</a>,
EFI Stub loading and UEFI booting in general. Reading through his clear, approachable
documentation made transitioning to UEFI a much simpler process than, given the
inherent complexity in the ecosystem, I would have thought possible.</p>

<p>Then there is Zsh.</p>

<blockquote><p>Because zsh contains many features, the zsh manual has been split into a number of sections…</p><footer><strong>zsh manual</strong> <cite><a href='http://linux.die.net/man/1/zsh'>linux.die.net/man/1/zsh/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>And goes it on to list those <em>seventeen</em> sections. If you are not a fan of <code>man</code> pages<sup>1</sup>,
there is the
<a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/zsh_toc.html" title="What it says on the tin…">Zsh Documentation</a>,
the <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide/zshguide.html" title="User's Guide">User&#8217;s Guide</a> and
<a href="http://zshwiki.org/home/" title="Zsh Wiki">wiki</a>. This amounts to a literally staggering
amount of information—it is no wonder that preconfigured zsh systems like
<a href="http://grml.org/zsh/" title="grml homepage">grml</a> are so popular; they provide
relatively simple ingress to the byzantine ways of this powerful shell.</p>

<p>Finally, also last year, I was privileged to chair the judging for the
<a href="http://www.nzosa.org.nz/" title="NZOSA site">2012 New Zealand Open Source Awards</a>.
This exposed me to the amazing contribution
<a href="http://man7.orgi/mtk.index.html" title="Man pages Michael maintains">Michael Kerrisk</a>
has made to GNU/Linux over the last decade. He is the author, or co-author, of
<em>over 300</em> <code>man</code> pages; and these aren&#8217;t the glamorous, application pages read
by the masses, but the system pages that document the kernel and <code>glibc</code>
<acronym title="Application Program Interface">APIs</acronym>.</p>

<p>All of this suggests to me that the state of documentation for FOSS is
anything but parlous. At every turn over the last year, when I needed to
be able to refer to documentation for a project, there was a surfeit of it.
And I have only touched on what would normally constitute the primary
sources; there is also all of the other community-driven documentation
around projects, like the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/" title="The BEST GNU/LINUX wiki on the web">Arch Wiki</a>
or the <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/" title="Unix &amp; Linux SE">Stack Exchange sites</a>,
the support available on forums, IRC, blog posts, etc.</p>

<p>Compared to the sterile, mostly out-of-date (and expensive) documentation that
accompanies proprietary software, FOSS is an Alexandrine utopia…</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>And, god knows, <em>I am</em>; <code>man</code> pages are a constant source of knowledge
and delight (and pretty much the only way I can contribute to projects that
I am indebted to).</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261312/Blog-images/uefi.jpg" title="'Samsung Series 9 Laptop'" >
Just before Christmas my
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jasonwryan/eeepc/src" title="Bitbucket repo for Archer">EeePC 901</a> started
to behave erratically. Rather than prolong the final throes, I decided to replace it and,
after looking around and having played with a colleague&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.cnet.com.au/samsung-series-9-13-inch-2012-339341806.htm" title="CNet Review">Samsung Series 9</a>,
I decided that I would swallow my pride, pay the Windows tax and opt for one of these sleek, fast
little notebooks. Given my experience with it over the last six to eight weeks, I am confident that
it was a decision that I am unlikely to regret.</p>

<p>The machine came with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8#Secure_boot" title="Wikipedia entry on Windows 8">Secure Boot</a>
enabled and running Windows 8.<sup>1</sup> After sedulously ignoring the mounting number
of posts on the Arch boards that had <acronym title="Unified Extensible Firmware Interface">UEFI</acronym>
in the title, initially convinced that it had something to do with Apple hardware and therefore
would be unlikely to impact on me at any point in the future, I now found myself in the position of
having to understand all of the disparate elements involved in UEFI booting.</p>

<p>This proved to be a non-trivial task. It is not that there is insufficient information
available; quite the opposite. The Arch Wiki has a typically thorough
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/UEFI" title="Arch Wiki page">entry on UEFI</a>; the real
challenge is revealed when you scroll to the bottom of that page to the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/UEFI#See_also" title="See also section">reference links</a>
where you begin to reach an appreciation that this isn&#8217;t a drop-in replacement for
Grub in the way <a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/07/09/syslinux/" title="My post on moving to Syslinux">Syslinux was</a>,
for example. This is a whole new booting ecosystem.</p>

<p>I wanted a LVM on LUKS setup and, after reading <em>a lot</em> more documentation on
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/UEFI_Bootloaders" title="Arch Wiki entry">UEFI bootloaders</a>,
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPT" title="Arch Wiki GPT page">GUID Partition Tables</a> and
<a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/efistub.html" title="Rod Smith's excellent site">EFISTUB</a><sup>2</sup>
than I had bargained on, I felt reasonably well equipped to proceed. And while this was an
admittedly time consuming (and sometimes confusing) process, I believe it was worth it.</p>

<p>Once I had a reasonable grasp of the conceptual model—and I am convinced this is the single
biggest hurdle in this process—I chose the EFISTUB boot approach with
<a href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/gummiboot" title="gummiboot homepage">gummiboot</a>,
as the boot manager; mostly because it seemed the simplest approach (the name may also
have been a factor).</p>

<p>Armed with all this new knowledge, I embarked on the install process. It didn&#8217;t take long at
all. Mostly because I couldn&#8217;t boot in UEFI mode from the USB drive.</p>

<p>Turns out a couple of things were thwarting me; one I had disabled Secure Boot
in the UEFI menu, but had neglected to disable the fast boot option. Secondly,
and more worryingly, I kept encountering kernel panics once I had got the
machine to boot. Seems that booting in UEFI mode triggers a nasty
<a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47121" title="On the Kernel bugtracker">bug with the samsung_laptop module</a>.</p>

<p>Once I could boot from the USB drive, I was able to successfully complete the install.
Rather than include a blow-by-blow account of that process here, I
have uploaded
<a href="https://gist.github.com/4618490" title="Gist with installation details">a gist with the details</a>,
for the morbidly curious or preternaturally bored.</p>

<p>The whole process, for me, epitomised what Arch is really about. No matter how comfortable
a point you reach with your understanding of the tools you use, the rolling release model
constantly challenges you to adopt and adapt to new technologies. Sure, I could have just
opted to boot in regular BIOS mode, but what would be the point of that? I wouldn&#8217;t have
<em>learned</em> anything.</p>

<p>The other thing that quickly became apparent is that, contrary to some commentary
on the boards about the
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/news/install-media-20120715-released/" title="News item on new install method">removal of the AIF</a>,
the new install scripts are quite superb; simple, direct and quite unambiguous, the whole
install procedure now feels a lot more Arch-like. The developers have done a great
job with these tools.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

had the misfortune to encounter (and I include Vista and Ubuntu&#8217;s Unity in that
cavalcade of fail)…</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;ll post more on the voluminous documentation around this, and other aspects of
GNU/Linux, in the coming weeks.</p></li>
